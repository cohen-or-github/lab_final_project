"i know we’re young, we make mistakes. but there’s a lot that still isn’t morally right. 

(for some context)- me and him have been on and off for the last 7 years or so.. this has been mainly due to immaturity. he cheated on me a couple times and was unloyal during our relationship on and off growing up. however i always excused his behavior for him just being young and not knowing right from wrong. it wasn’t until i moved in 2020 and we finally ended things “for good” and went no contact for a while up until last april 2023. we rekindled and talked here and there but i finally went back to see him in october after not seeing him for three years. 

fast forward to present day.. we have been dating for the last 8 months. it was amazing at first because we were so happy to reconnect. a month into us dating, i noticed a hickey on his neck that wasn’t from me. (we are currently in long distance and have been since we got together) so you would see how this would be an issue. he played it off like it was nothing and it was a very difficult thing to look past. i went to visit him in late may, and noticed a lot of things. i am not the usual type to go through others phones as i see it as a invasion of privacy, however i felt like my gut was telling me to. 

I found a collage of nudes from girls that were old, however they were still in his phone in his camera roll. i came across a dick pic in his recently deleted, but it wasn’t ever sent to me. he still has love letters from a past fling, and has yet to dump them. he ABSOLUTELY REFUSES!! to end a SNAPCHAT STREAK with this girl that he’s “good friends” with. It felt like he would rather choose this stupid streak over my comfort in our relationship. he’s been a serial cheater in his past relationships but the delusion in me wants me to think that i am special. i don’t want to come off as insecure, or crazy but this man is rlly making me feel crazy. whenever i bring up problems to him he just lasts seems to approach it with so much aggression and anger. when i bring things up to him i just want reassurance and comfort, as well as clarity. but it just doesn’t go that way. we don’t go on date nights, and he never gets me flowers anymore :( i am just lost and drained  Here's an advice from an older man to a young one.

That shit called ""gut feeling"" ??...yeah...that.

Fucking never ever doubt it. Be it in love, family, health or even on random things. That gut feeling thing is a form of blessing straight from big ""G"" himself. 

If it says.. ""walk"" ...then you better fucking run like hell. [Practical Advice]"
"So, my girlfriend and I have been together for around a year, living together for 6 months. We have, up until now, had an ""open phone policy"" where our fingerprints are stored on each others' respective phones, funnily enough being her idea. Neither of us actually check the other's phone (never, not once), but it comes in handy for Googling something or changing the music in the car when one phone is more easily accessibly than the other. A pretty good solution, actually.

Until yesterday. We were casting YouTube videos from her phone to the downstairs TV, and she went to the toilet, so I grabbed it to queue some stuff up. ""Fingerprint not recognised"". Interesting.

For some more context, my girlfriend struggles with her mental health and is currently going through a lot with trialling different medications and some work-related stuff, I've been struggling too since I've been taking the brunt of it. The last couple of months have been really rough on us both and we aren't getting along as well as we used to, even though we still love each other. There's some light at the end of the tunnel (moving soon to her hometown) but for now, it's a struggle.

Now when I think that, to remove my fingerprint from her phone, she'd have had to go into the settings, likely remove all the fingerprints she's got set up (since they're unnamed and she's not the techiest person) and then add her own back on, I get a bit concerned. Open phone policy or not, I feel a little awkward asking about it because I don't want to feel like she has to give me access to anything, even if she has access to mine. 

My mind is obviously catastrophising about this, she could just as easily be planning to get me a gift or something than she would be cheating or anything like that, but with the issues that we're going through as a couple recently I'm starting to wonder if there might be a legitimate reason to have trust issues.

Is it weird that, for the first time since we got together, the only time I want to check her phone is now she's rescinded my ability to do just that?  The gut never lies. Something is definitely wrong for her to suddenly remove it, especially seeing as it was her idea. Better to just ask her or it will eat you up. [Practical Advice]"
"12/31/2019: got married to wife in the US.

5/1/2024: found out wife had been cheating on me with a former friend of mine. Wife denies. We go to friend’s place 4 hrs away to check their evidence. Found solid evidence. Wife claims to be poly and cheats some more. 

5/10: Came back home together. Wife behaves repentant and agrees to stop. 

5/25: Wife locks self in room and refuses to come out, and then went on a “road trip”. Hint: more cheating. I pretend to not know.

She came back just now. I feel happy to see her and unhappy to know what she’s been up to. 

I still want to see how this goes before proceeding with a divorce. If you stay with her the cheating will never end. You'll become her doormat. 

She's gonna promise to stop cheating and she even might for a little while til she does it again. And the cycle will just continue. 

Please do yourself a favor and get a divorce. [Practical Advice]"
"Throwaway because he knows I lurk on here. 
I (F34) have trouble trusting my boyfriend (M35) after he has cheated in a past relationship. A bit of context: About 4 years before meeting me, my boyfriend had a pretty long relationship (10+ years), which ended up with them breaking up after he realised he wasn't in love with her or happy anymore. They started dating as teenagers and had a break-up in-between, but then resumed dating, which according to him was a mistake. During the second part of the relationship he ended up cheating on her several times.

He was reluctant about telling me because he has had a relationship end after 7 months once she found out about it. I can't say I was particularly thrilled to know what about him and I've had times when I start getting paranoid and distrustful. I know the easiest way would be to break up with him, but we've been seeing each other for 3 years now and things are really nice between us. He's never given me a chance to doubt him, but I'm a bit on the anxious side and will spiral sometimes because ""cheaters will always be cheaters"". I see it is hurting him and the relationship to get constantly grilled about it. He says he was young and stupid and only thought about himself, but he has changed now and wouldn't do that to someone else and that he'd break up before ever acting on something or cheating. I want to believe him and that he's a reformed man, but I also don't want to end up feeling stupid, if he actually does cheat on me. I guess, I need some advice from people that have been in his position and have indeed changed. Is that possible? Or am I being naive? I know in the end there's no 100% guarantee he won't cheat, but I just want to hear some other perspectives. My friends all think like me. Ultimately, it's your decision to believe he is a changed person or not. So, you can choose to leave or stay. If he seems to really deeply love and care for you, you should take his word. Give yourself a few weeks and then decide how you feel again. I'm sure that came as a shocker to you, but if you rethink about all the times your boyfriend has been good to you, maybe that trust will start to build again. You both have been together for 3 years, within that time did you see any signs of him cheating or having interest in other women? If you trusted him till now, then you should take his word. Its really your decision to trust him again or not.  [Practical Advice]"

Summary of the last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/rEhmaIEG7G):

We broke up 9 months ago because he disrespected me, was emotionally abusive, lied, and pressured me for sex. He came back with a long apology and promises, and despite my hesitation, nostalgia made me give him another chance. After 2 days of talking, I felt something was off, so I made a fake Bumble account. Sadly, I found him there, flirting and claiming to be single. While messaging this fake girl, he was also sending me sweet texts.

I didn't confront him immediately. Instead, I blocked him everywhere and sent an email saying I lost interest and wished him well, without mentioning the cheating. He replied wanting to stay in touch, but that's not happening.


—-
Now to the recent event, 

He reached out again, by email, with the classic “i miss you” message.

I’ve been looking at the email and distracting myself with work, and other stuff, but i have to admit, i am in an emotional wreck. 

I genuinely feel so conflicted and horribly stressed. 

I want to move on, so badly, and i wanna let go of the thought of him as being my man, and my lover. But he keeps coming back, placing me in the situation where i am so little and out of control.

Stupid questions whirling in my mind, but finding answers to them is futile; there is no way that i am taking him back. 


Yet, this “i miss you” been lingering in my email and causing me pain, loneliness and grief. 



 He misses having a steady source of sex. [Commentator's opinion]"
"Why do girls like skinny guys?  From my experience, girls like every type of body. It’s all about preference. I like bulkier guys, and some of my girl friends really like skinny guys. Some girls like a nice medium of the types. I don’t think there’s one reason why girls like skinny guys. It’s just about personal taste. [Commentator's opinion]"
"There's this girl at my work and I can't help but glance at her whenever she passes by and I feel bad for doing it because I feel creepy. Even admitting it to friends that I like someone makes me feel stupid and/or weird.

I don't know why but I suppose me finding a girl attractive and looking at her makes me feel creepy. It's weird, I know, but can anyone help? Well you did say glance. But one day you going glance so much you going get whiplash. Don’t upgrade to staring it’s definitely creepy especially if you’re saying nothing. Say hi, start a conversation. [Practical Advice]"
"I moved in with my girlfriend four months ago, leaving my 10 year old dog home with my family as I felt it would be unfair to change so much of her life. Unfortunately, yesterday she passed away and I woke up to multiple texts and voicemails from my family frantically saying she was on the verge of death, hoping I'd answer so that I could be there in her final moments. I had to spend the day finding somewhere we could bring her to get her cremated and overall it was a difficult day mentally, and I'm sure it will continue to be as I grieve her passing. 

My girlfriend at the time was visiting her friends and staying the night for a handful of days so that they could Lan party an update for a game that had just come out. When I told her about my dogs passing she was sympathetic and initially said she'd make plans to come home early and have someone pick her up as she doesn't drive. During that conversation I said that it was up to her if she wanted to come home early or not and that she could stay if she wanted. I wanted her to be able to enjoy the plans she had set and although I would have wanted her home during this difficult time for me, I didn't tell her so. 

She ended up choosing to stay another 36~ hours and play the game, and her choosing that over me is making me feel awful. I told her the night she came back and her immediate reaction is to shift blame on me saying that I had tricked her by saying it was her decision and that these were plans she had made for a long time with her friends so she couldn't just bail on them. The conversation kept getting more and more aggressive so I slept on the couch instead. 

I'm just wondering where I should go from here? What you all would feel or say in my shoes, and if I'm in the wrong by not being more upfront that I would have rather had her home to console me. You told her yourself she didn't have to go back home, so she didn't. If you wanted her home, you should've told her you wanted her home instead of this ""if you want"" shit [Commentator's opinion]"
"i've (20F) been seeing this guy (20M) for a month now. we've both agreed we're looking for something casual cause he's only back home for the summer and i don't think i want to be in a relationship rn. we go on the best dates! and get along pretty well and it's been great so far. he also lost his virginity to me...which i didn't mind cause i was pretty new at the game, and we've gotten better together lol. it's been great.

now i catch feelings really easy, especially when im intimate with someone, but i've been trying to remind myself it's just casual/ just a summer fling. we don't talk everyday, usually save conversation for when we're together or only text when there's something to talk about. he's a very chill guy, super layed back so i can't really tell how he feels. and i'm a bit shy to ask him.

but it's starting to feel not so casual anymore, cause the sex is amazing, and the way he holds me and treats me & and just-omg, it doesn't feel like it's ""just sex"" or ""causal"" it feels like so much more, how am i not supposed to catch feelings? & sigh... am i being delusional? like where do i go from here? i’ve been in a very similar situation before. long story short, if you are starting to catch feelings, and want to pursue something- in my opinion, speak up! on the other hand, if you want to stay casual, either keep going with the flow, or end things if it’s getting too serious.

"For context, I’m an 18F from South Africa, and I went to an all girls school so I really don’t have a lot of experience with boys. 

I’m very close with my mother and grandmother and I trust their opinions. Recently though, they got on my case about the stretch marks on my thighs, hips and breasts. I got them because I didnt eat or exercise well as a child and my weight fluctuated a lot. They told me that I would feel embarrassed when I went to the beach because boys don’t find that attractive. I’ve come to terms with the marks on my thighs and hips but I’m still very self conscious about the ones on my breasts.

I’ve never kissed or dated a guy and want to know from the perspective of any guy that’s older than 16, are stretch marks something you guys pay attention to? 

And girls, should I look into like cosmetics and stuff to get rid of them or leave the marks as they are? Your mother and grandmother should be deeply ashamed of themselves for making you feel bad about your body and planting this nonsense in your head.

Almost all women have stretch marks---it has nothing to do with eating and exercising, they occur in most skin type when hips and breasts rapidly develop. Some lessen over time and others don't. And men get stretch marks too. It's not a big deal. The vast majorty of men don't give the slightest fuck about stretch marks, they're just happy to be seeing a woman in any state of undress and they're thinking about a lot of things but NOT strech marks. 

Next time your mother and grandmother try to undermine your confidence you tell them you're sorry they hate their own bodies so much but you love your body just as it is and you walk away. This is THEIR problem. DO  NOT own their shit.

You are fine just as you are. [Emotional Support]"
"Hi guys my boyfriend of 4 years confessed to me that he cheated on me on 1st year of our relationship.
He said he wants to marry but he couldn't start it without keeping this secret and he bursted out in tears.
He said he was scared because he had past bad relationship and when he was falling in love with me it scared him so he went out and had sex with someone else after that he felt disgusted and hated him and knew I was the one.
He thought keeping it secret would keep relationship safe but he couldn't keep it anymore as it was killing him.

I don't know how to feel I am confused and don't know if I even know him.He said that's the only thing he ever kept secret. The image of him with other women and named makes me sick and disgusted. Also I don't want to throw away 4 years of relationship and good memory. What a dumb excuse for cheating. ""Oh I cheated cause I just loved you to much."" Chester's cheat. Hell do it again. Leave. He literally went ""oh I knew I didn't want anyone else after having someone else"" like wtf [Commentator's opinion]"

To try and keep this is short as possible I’ve been seeing a girl on and off for 6 months over the last month or two I felt it becoming more serious. However the problem is her feelings towards me change constantly from telling me she wants to go on dates to saying she couldn’t see her dating me. Saying she’s over her Ex ( two year relationship) to that she doesn’t know if it’s over between them. For whatever reason I can’t bring myself to live the situation so I’m really stuck on what to do if I just wait out and see or try no contact even though we speak for hours every day. Just need advice on what I should do.

"Hello everyone,

My partner (F23) of 6 months currently brags about their sex life with their ex and how they would « make her cry by fingering her so good », how many times they would have sex per day/week, and how long it would last. I (F23) can’t be fingered because or vaginismus and sometimes i force myself to ask my partner to finger me because I feel shitty and stupid compared to their ex. 
My partner never made a single comment on my vaginismus and stop when I tell them It hurts me when we try. When we have sex it is good, but then they would go talking about their ex. 

I don’t know what to do because it makes me feel like crap. It’s my first lesbian relationship. 
I need advice on how I should manage this situation please. Should I try to manage my jealousy or should I break up since it’s hurting me so bad ?

Please remember i don’t want anyone to receive hate

Thank you xx Break up. There is no reason to date someone who treats you like this. [Practical Advice]"
"I've never dated anyone who hasn't cheated on me or looked at other girls in that way. I feel like this is the norm nowadays. But I know I'd never have to worry about him cheating, he's truly in love with me and I love that. Plus he wants to do everything for me, make sure I'm happy, wants to make me comfortable and do things I want. Except he doesn't like me talking to male friends we are both friends with, or even go out by myself with my female friends.

I know it's not much to go off of but I would like to know some opinions on that alone. The best princess treatment, I've only seen in movies and books but extremely jealous... He’s not in love with you after “a little over a month”, that’s absurd - google lovebombing

And he’s isolating you from your friends after only a few weeks. That’s about as big a red flag as I can think of

"My (25F) boyfriend (30M) is from another country. He’s currently traveling back to his home country to go to a friend’s wedding. Our relationship is relatively new and he already had his itinerary for the trip planned, so that’s why I didn’t go with him. He also already had a date to the wedding. His friend of 8 years, we’ll call her Emily. 

Emily has tried to get with him before. Back when he got engaged to his first wife. He has since divorced the wife, and has not gone to Emily. 

For this trip, he explained to me that they were just friends and that he firmly laid out boundaries. I didn’t mind. I’m relatively secure in myself. He can have a friend date to a wedding. That doesn’t bother me. He told me that he hasn’t bragged about his new relationship to her because he doesn’t want to hurt her feelings, but she knows he’s in a relationship. 

Even still she has firmly communicated that she wants to sleep with him. 

Now he’s there and he let it slip that they are staying in the same hotel room. I didn’t know this so it blindsided me. He says he thought he told me before. Maybe but I don’t know. Apparently they each have their own bedroom and bathroom so they’re separate. 

Not only that, but they’re sharing a hotel from Saturday to Monday. I thought he had his own hotel and was just hanging out with her for hikes and then the wedding. 

I don’t know what to do with this information. I’m very attached to this relationship but it’s new. I want to trust him but not be dumb. 

He apologized to me and told me he would try to repair. Whatever I needed. I don’t know what to say to that. Originally he was avoiding calling me in front of her to spare her feelings. I told him to call me tonight from the hotel. Not blasting it in front of her face but making sure I exist. I don’t know what to do. What do I say?

Tldr - my boyfriend is on a foreign country staying in a hotel with a woman (who we know wants to sleep with him) for 3 days and I don’t know what to do.  “Oh I thought I already told you…” 

He’s lying and just trying to cover his ass after letting it slip. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I'm (M25) about to get married to F20 and I'm kinda stressed about being able to get it up in the bedroom - we'll be losing our virginity on the wedding night.

My friend is a doctor and I told him about my stress, and asked him if Viagra was an option for me. He said just buy Viagra Connect from the pharmacy without a prescription and keep it at the bedside table for peace of mind so I know I have a ""backup option"".

So I bought a pack of 50mg Viagra Connect and tested one out just to see if it would actually work (it did).

I have two questions which made me post this to see if I can get some answers:

1. Would it be weird/off-putting to a girl if I took this Viagra connect on my wedding night? I'm planning on being completely upfront with my wife, explaining to her that I'm nervous and a medical professional recommended this to me. I don't plan on using it my entire life, just the rare ""special occasions"" like this so that I have that extra confidence boost.
2. I don't know how you're supposed to get an erection with your wife in the first place. Does she just touch my penis until it gets big and then I perform the intercourse? This always confused me because I hear people online saying they can get one just by looking at a girl, etc. - but that never happens to me. Very rarely do I get an erection by thinking of something and not touching myself.

TL;DR - I'm nervous about losing my virginity on my wedding night and don't know how intimacy works. You definitely need to have a conversation with your partner about this, and tell her your worries. Personally, I wouldn’t take the viagra straight away on your wedding night when you’re about to get into sex. 

The build up to intercourse should get you excited and erect. And by build up I mean making out, touching each other, giving each other foreplay first. You definitely shouldn’t go straight into intercourse without giving each other abit of foreplay beforehand because your partner won’t get excited enough and won’t be aroused and will make intercourse painful for her, especially since it’ll be her first time.

"My friend didn’t show up to my birthday party. I planned it about two weeks ago and she came to my house in the morning before my party to do her hair and she said she is going to a cricket match with her friend so she might be a bit late. So i said thats ok. I got to my party and i told the rest of my friends that she will be late (there was only four of us and we had gone to an arcade). Half way through the arcade she didn’t come and i tried calling her and sending her messages. Then i had dinner reservations and we all went for dinner and I still hadn’t her from her. 

We finished at 10:30 and i was home by 11pm. And as I was walking home from the train station she called me and she said she went to the after party for the match with her friend and didn’t realise the time. At that point she had asked if she could stay over at my house because it was almost midnight and there were no trains back to her house late at night. I didn’t feel comfortable for her to have no where to stay as it was getting late. So she ended up staying over. I’m not sure whether this is ok. I did find it a bit rude that she didn’t make an effort to come to my party but then asked to stay over at my house. I don’t know if i should just distance myself from her? 

Her grandma also passed away a few weeks ago and her family lives abroad and i took time out to take her to the airport as well as pick her up from the airport too.

"Last night during dinner, my husband (40m)and I (43f) were talking about another couple in his family and their financial situation. Mostly because of my curiosity about how their situation works because the wife doesn’t have a job.

In the course of that conversation, my husband said very casually “we could replace your contribution to the family for $36,000.” He then went on to elaborate that there’s a range between about $34,000 and $39,000 that he values as my financial value to the household.

I have a six figure job.

He pays our mortgage, utilities, and all the subscriptions like the streaming networks and club memberships and annual pass stuff for the kid. 

I pay for our groceries, our kid’s daycare, and our health insurance. We each pay our own debt. Mine is in student loans. His is in business financing and personal credit cards. We each pay for one vacation per year.

I said “i don’t think that’s right. I’m the one putting money into a 401k, I pay my student loans.”

He said “sure. But those are your accounts. Both are pre-marital and I’m talking about money that benefits the family. What I’d have to replace if we didn’t have your income.”

Should I be worried about divorce?

He knows, off the top of his head, what he’d have to do to replace me and he didn’t figure taking my debt into account.

I sometimes wonder about our finances because we’ve never consolidated. We each have our own checking and savings. Our credit cards are separate, except one of my Christmas gifts was an Amex card on his account so I could get the travel perks when we’re traveling separately. About once a month he shows me his financials, usually his credit score, debts, and cash on hand. But we never talk about a budget. He’s never asked to see mine. Sometimes he will make reference to the fact that I’m over investing in my 401k and IRA because he sees them when he does our taxes.

Our marriage hasn’t been great in a while. I’m working on it and got some good advice from this community. But I’d never really thought he might surprise me with a divorce until last night.

Is it odd that he knew that number off the top of his head? Should I be worried that he’s got a plan that so easily severs me from our family?

TLDR: my husband seems to have a plan to live without me. Should I be worried he’s planning to leave?







 If doesn’t sound like a plan with intent. He’s just done the math because your relationship hasn’t been great.

There is a difference between knowing what you would do and wanting to do it.

Additionally, you both live like single people being married. So it makes his math easier to him. 

No point worrying because it won’t change anything.  Focus on the relationship where you can. [Practical Advice]"
"So I’ve been on two dates with this girl.


We hit it off instantly, make each other laugh heaps, share interests, and there’s undeniable chemistry. It’s really rare that I meet someone so gorgeous that I connect with so well, and so naturally I’m super into her. 

After our last date she made clear she’d be busy for the next several days. Fair enough. Up to this point, all signs were good. 

Here’s the thing. We were having a casual conversation over text after, and I asked her a pretty  casual question (how was work?). It’s been two days with no response. One part of me thinks this is no big deal, and the other is freaking out because it’s possible I’m being ghosted. 

On one hand, she did say she was busy and all other signs point to stuff being fine. 

On the other, two days is a pretty long time and she’s been viewing my instagram stories and stuff so it’s not like she’s not on her phone. 

Generally my attitude is “if they wanted to they would” but damn. I just really want to keep seeing her and I’d be so bummed if this turned out to be a ghost situation. 

What do we think? I absolutely hate double texting so I’m going to just wait and see if she replies, but I’m just not sure if this is cause for alarm. 

Cheers  I’m a woman, and when I get busy, I pause on texting because I need to

So I have a friend with benefits. We were friends before we hooked up. We first slept together last Sunday. We hung out all week except two days. I told him I liked him and he said he liked me too… though he said he didn’t want anything serious and was resistant. I asked him to come over yesterday and he said he was tired. That makes sense because he worked all day. I am wondering if I should see if he wants to come over tonight. Should I wait for him to text or just go ahead and text him?

"Just as the title says. 

This is one of the reasons I broke up with him, but my ex boyfriend shared it with his friends after he said he wouldn’t. I asked him not too. 

The picture was focused on my chest. He was in it too. His face was showing, and his hands were covering my n*pples. You can see the rest of my chest though, and the picture was when we were having sex. 

I’m obviously hurt, and feel disrespected for disregard of my privacy, but I can’t help to feel like I’m wavering back and forth between having a perfectly valid response to a nude being shared without my consent or if I overreacted - sometimes I think to myself that “you can’t even see my n*pples, so no big deal.” 

The relationship is over, and I’m not going back, but I just need some validation that this is a huge deal breaker.  It is a deal breaker. You are right to feel this way. [Emotional Support]"

No, I cheated in my 20’s. I deeply regret it and learned a lot about myself and life afterwards. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I've been in a happy relationship with a guy for almost a year now, we've been known each other for much longer. His ex broke up with him last summer but presumably he got over her before we started dating. We did not have any problems so far, we talked about his past relationship numerous times and he made sure he is over her. I did not see any red flags or anything, he didn't mention her or anything, I didn't see him looking at her profile or so. In short, nothing concerning 

However, recently, we have been cleaning the house and he found a postcard she wrote him for his bday. He put in in the folder. I asked him if he wants to throw it away and he told me that he keeps all the letters and cards from his exes and never throws them away. However, he said he doesn't reread them, go over them etc, just does not throw them away. I know that I should not judge people by myself but if I know that I don't want to read it, why keep it? I feel kinda uncomfortable knowing that there is a folder somewhere in the box with all the romantic things his exes were writing him but I can't make him throw it away too. 

I asked him what the reason is for that and he seems like he doesn't know himself, he keeps saying ""I am doing it since high school and I don't want to change my tradition"". He compared it to not deleting the conversation with your exes, he said ""well you did not delete it, didn't you? But it is equally personal as the cards, isn't it?"" I did not know how to react, the chat does not feel the same as the love letters of course but... I dont know what to think, is it my issue or problem that I am worried about it? Should I just accept? You should not do anything. Keeping letters or cards from an old girlfriend doesn’t mean he’s still loves them, it just means that he values what they gave him and the time he spent with them. Looking at old love letters where a past partner complemented him might boost his self-esteem. keeping old love letters is way healthier than having to burn everything given to you in a relationship once it’s over. 

If things are good in your relationship and you want to continue, maybe you should ask him what he values about letters/cards. Maybe you should write him notes/letters/cards for birthdays, telling him what you love about him. [Practical Advice]"
"Actually, I (F53) know the answer; I just have to cut this off. But still I have doubts. So please provide your advice with explanation.



I went on 2 dates with a man who, in theory, was a good fit for me. What are red flags for me; he (51) has never been in a relationship and I found out yesterday that he doesn't seem to have any friends either.



I also got the feeling that he was trying to pressure me to quickly schedule a new date with him after the first date by indicating that he had a date with another woman but that he wanted a second date with me first. I then said that if he wanted to date someone else, he should do so. But I don't think there was anyone else.



But the problem is mainly that he is terribly physical. Within 10 minutes of the first date he was constantly seeking physical contact. Sitting too close to me (read: sitting against me), touching my hair, shoulders, arms, sitting and things like that. And his talking mainly consisted of giving me compliments, which is also awkward. When saying goodbye he also tried to go a little further, but I was able to hold that off.



Now we went to a festival together. First he introduced me to his parents (he still lives at home) and we had a drink with them, which I thought was strange for the second date. At the party itself I was more concerned with guarding my boundaries than enjoying the music. He was constantly touching me, pulling me against him, trying to press my buttocks against his crotch, etc. Very uncomfortable. If I pushed him away, he would stay away from me for a moment and then sit next to me again. And just keep giving compliments. I was dreading the moment of saying goodbye and sure enough... he immediately pushed his tongue deep into my mouth. I abruptly pushed him away and said that he was going way too fast and that he should slow down so I can relax too. He indicated that perhaps he wanted it too much.



In retrospect I should have said something different; His behavior on both dates doesn't make me feel safe with him. The fact that I dread saying goodbye because I'm afraid he will assault or even rape me is an important sign. He can say that he accepts a No, but his behavior says otherwise.



So another question; What should I say to him in a text to make it clear to him that I don't want to date him anymore? I hope he can learn something from it. This is a hard one because he sounds incredibly lonely. On one hand, you kinda want to help the guy out on what Not to do on a date. He definitely needs some dating advice. But he also needs to find someone who will love him for who he is... even if it's a bit on the creepy side. 

People tend to push their own needs on to others... he needs affection,physical touch, and words of affirmation. I don't think you speak the same love language, and that's a good enough reason and a gentle letdown. [Commentator's opinion]"
"Sorry, this is my first post.

We've been together for 8 months now, long distance. I was diagnosed with both ADHD and ASD on December 2022. I let her know of my disorders and she seemed pretty understanding, telling me that it didn't matter. It's important to acknowledge she has BPD.

But now I feel like I'm ruining our relationship due to my disorders. The main problem is me ignoring her. Sometimes I'll just be spoken to and I won't realize, or I won't understand that I'm supposed to respond. This has been going on since we started dating.

It barely ever happens when we're alone, but when other people are present it gets way worse. I'll just forget that I'm part of the conversation unless I'm spoken to and reminded plenty of times that I'm supposed to speak.

I've tried reminding myself in a variety of ways, but it always happens again.

We've had plenty of arguments about it, I always promise I'll change but I just end up doing it again.

Today I think it's her last straw. I ignored her again because I didn't know how to respond to what she said.

I understand it triggers her a lot because of past trauma, but I really can't help it, it's beyond me.

I honestly don't understand if there's something im doing wrong. I want it to work, but I just feel like I'm ruining everything with things that I can't do anything about.

Is there any way I can stop this from happening?

tl;dr: im ruining my relationship by ignoring my partner because of my autism and i dont know how to fix it so i wouldn’t say your ruining your relationship, but it’s important to acknowledge that autism is going to make relationships atypical. 

my bf is/was the same way, we had our share of fights about it too. it took understanding on both of our parts to finally reach a “happy” place. i put happy in quotes bc bc when i have to give him room to be quiet, i can get annoyed and it’s tough to keep it together yk? but we both work at it, right? when i see hes frozen up, i start to ask questions he can answer like “do you need a minute to think” or like asking him to just say the 1st things that come to mind and just kind of working together from there((even if im pissed)). i just have to take a step back and listen to him and figure out what’s next.

he’s got a bad problem w going mute and not listening when he just doesn’t know what to say to/about a situation or when he’s focused, and that got old after like the 1st year together. i’m a human at the end of the day, and it felt dehumanizing to be shut out like that. he listened to me when i brought it up and asked how to be more attentive, and just kinda tried harder over the years? im sure it took A LOT of personal work for him to start trying to make changes to a p ingrained behavior, but he’s definitely changed and like noticeably? it wasn’t instant by any means! like we’re about to hit 6 years in august and im sure it’s happened a handful of times, but now when he’s feeling overwhelmed or stuck he says that or asks what i need, instead of nothing. we only argue a handful of times a year so communication is really the key.

"So, there's this young woman in the dance class I've been taking for a few weeks. She is very nice and pretty and I really like her. The problem is, I think she's way out of my league. I'm 21 years old and still in the middle of my bachelor's degree and far from finishing it. I don't have a lot of money, I look average and I'm not particularly stable in life. The young woman, on the other hand, is 23 years old, two years older than me (I think most women don't like younger men). She is currently completing her master's degree and is otherwise very stable in life. Nevertheless, we get along well, even if we have only had purely platonic conversations so far. The conversations don't just come from me, she also often initiates conversations and asks questions. I think that means at least that she doesn't find me completely repulsive. My concern, however, is that she sees me more as a little brother than as a potential partner (I'm not only younger but also smaller than her). I've never asked a girl out before, so I'm very afraid to ask her. I'm afraid that it will come across as strange and ruin the atmosphere between us and in the course. Do I even have a chance with her or should I concentrate on myself and be stable in life before I look for a partner? sure there are times when we can say, we're not in a good spot to be dating or be in a relationship.  but usually that refers to emotional health or financial situation.  and even with a financial hardship, there are still people who can meet and date and do activities together, as long as you both do things within your budget.

and even people who are not ready emotionally or mentally, still date and find partners too.  
what you described about yourself, is totally fine to be getting out there and looking for a partner.  they just might somehow sabotage their own relationship but at least they're still looking and getting some.

a good chance to ask her out is when the class is almost over.  say something like ""hey it was fun talking to you, i'd like to get your contact info and ask you out sometime""

be explicit with the asking out , instead of something potentially neutral like ""hanging out"" or ""catch up sometime"" so that you can know if she's interested or not.  if she's not, no biggie, just move on.

it would be worse to still be seeing her outside of the class and still be interested in her but not knowing for sure if she's interested in you, in the case that neither one of you makes a definitive move or in the case that she actually does think of you as a little brother and is OK to meet you but you're over here thinking when can you hold her hand or kiss her.

"Hi,

I (23m) know that this topic is often discussed here. 

There is a woman in my courses, and we have exchanged a few words. I really enjoy our conversations, so I messaged her if she would like to meet up for a cup of coffee, and she agreed immediately. I haven't communicated this as a date. Would it be appropriate to give her some flowers when we meet, as a nice gesture? I don't want to rush things.

I've never had a date before, so any advice from your side would be helpful :) Personally, no, don’t bring flowers. Wait until the relationship becomes more established and intimate before bringing gifts such as flowers for her. [Practical Advice]"
"context: my boyfriend has a problem watching porn. we've discussed this in the past. he's into some really fringe stuff that i find absolutely disturbing and disgusting. i told him it makes me uncomfortable that he's watching that kind of porn while we're together especially bc he hid it from me in the beginning. i originally he was into that stuff by accident. i found it by looking through his reddit account after he sent me post. he told me it was a fetish he used to have but went away. a few months later, i found more of that porn that was viewed recently. i was so hurt he lied to me and i was disgusted by the images i saw. it nearly ended our relationship but i said id give him another chance if he promised to not watch porn of any kind. we talked about it and concluded he may have a porn addiction. i gave him the opportunity to tell me if he was struggling with it, to tell me first and i wouldn't be mad or leave him. basically while i was grossed out by his taste, i was mainly hurt that he lied to me for months. i even asked him multiple times through the follow months how he was doing and if he was okay. he always said it was easy and he wasn't struggling at all. then yesterday we were talking and i looked through his internet history, and i found that damn subreddit in his recently viewed. i know im shitty for going threw his history but i had been burned before and my intuition was telling me something was wrong. i turned the phone towards him and asked why that was there and he instantly started denying it and begging me to stay with him. but i yelled at him and told him to give me space and shut the door on his face. i haven't spoke to kin since. i don't know what to do, ive just been cry v all day. i feel so betrayed and confused. i can't look at him the same way, i can't even think about him the same way. where do i go from here? i don't know how to forgive him or if i even want to. all trust is gone. the first time nearly broke me, i don't deserve this and i don't want to break up with him but im starting to think that the only option

tldr: my boyfriend lied to me about watching what i consider deprived porn... again. i feel betrayed and hurt How to end a relationship! If you don’t want him doing it behind your back, let him be more flexible. Because you said no, he wants to see if he can get away with it. Allow the watching & it won’t be as fun.

"Should I tell this girl (18F) that her bf (24M) cheated on her with me (21F)?

So I (21F) was talking to this guy (24M) I was head over heels for a couple of months. As context, I had been crushing on this guy for about a year before we started talking and flirting with each other so I was really into him.  There was definitely something strange and I had an intuition that something was off, but I really liked him so I brushed it off. I found out that he had a girlfriend (18F) by accident and confronted him about this past winter. Initially he kind of brushed it off, asked what I was talking about. But eventually he kind of admitted to it and tried saying that we were only friends so it didn’t matter and pretending nothing ever happened between us. It was very strange and I didn’t really know how to feel about it. We didn’t talk for a couple months after that.


Fast forward to a couple months ago, we started talking again in a friendly matter. At this point, I didn’t really see a problem in being platonic with him, so we were just friendly. But he started to flirt again. I initially assumed (stupidly) that things between him and his gf must have fizzled out. As it turns out, he was still involved with her, but still flirts with me constantly. It’s a very strange feeling and I don’t really know what to do.

I still care about him and I don’t think he’s a terrible guy, just a bit of a player. I don’t know if I should tell the girl and send her screenshots. On one hand, I’m afraid of losing him since I really do care about him. On the other hand, I do feel bad for this girl and I think she deserves to know.

What’s the best course of action?

 I think you should ignore him and move on. He clearly has a girlfriend, and hasn’t broke it off with her. Don’t be the side chick that’s a big no no but when it comes to telling the gf, you could, but you don’t know if she might still stay with him. There’s plenty of other guys in the sea that are mature and honest. And don’t hide their gf lol [Practical Advice]"
"ok so there’s this guy at my gym who i have been crushing on for a while now. we would pretty much have the same exact workout schedule and would see each other 24/7. we would park close to each other, and make-prolonged- eye contact. so one day i finally got the courage to go up to him as we were both leaving and give him a compliment about his car (bc it was obvious he’d modified it). his response wasn’t that great. he said “oh ok thank you” not rude, not overly nice, just kinda neutral. after that i was pretty defeated. its been about a month since then and ever since he has not stopped looking at me. at first i was very harsh on myself like “omg why did i do that, there’s no way he would’ve liked me” (based off his answer) but now idk we make eye contact so much that i could be standing still, but if he’s walking his eyes are following me the whole time… he gives off a shy vibe for sure from what I’ve gathered and now looking back on our interaction, i think i caught him off guard? but also why hasn’t he came up to me, if ive already opened that door for him too… maybe i wasn’t direct enough, and is it potentially worth it to risk trying again? all in all, i feel like if he was completely repulsed by me, he wouldn’t be staring at me so much? idk i go back and forth, i just don’t want to get it wrong. As a dude I genuinely don’t know how to react sometimes when I’m not expecting a compliment or attention, especially at the gym/grocery store etc where I’m doing my own thing. He might also be into you but just gets shy. 

Maybe give him a bit to see if he warms up to you, if it’s been a week or two or whatever I say shoot your shot again. Not much to lose here imo [Practical Advice]"
"Please read!! 

I F20 and my bf M20 have been together for almost 2 years now and also have a 6 month old baby..

Before moving in together we had a good sex life (looking back now it was mainly while we were drunk on weekends), we moved in together a few months into my pregnancy and all was good. We still had regular sex up until a few weeks before the birth of our baby. Since then I would say I could count how many times we’ve done it on both hands. I constantly feel like I have to beg for it and he always has an excuse! Since moving in together I’ve had a funny feeling about something and thought he might be cheating to which he denied. 

A few weeks ago I went on his phone as I’ve never been able to shake this feeling, I look on his history of Reddit and it was 95% filled with “femboys” porn and girls with dicks! I had a look again tonight and it was filled with the same!!! I thought the first time he might be gay or bisexual but I talked myself down and told myself he must be having a joke with the boys?!… but since coming across all that again I really think he might be. How do I know for certain or am I just being nieve? How do I address this? I need help!! Hes most likely bi sexual and was embarrassed to share that with you. 
The question is ... is this a deal breaker for you? Be warned tho.. how you choose to approach this will set the tone for the rest of your relationship. [Emotional Support]"

I (M) am getting married and we’re waiting till marriage. 

I’ll admit my sex education is very poor, nobody ever taught me when I was a kid and I had to Google everything myself.

What I’m about to ask may sound like common sense, but please keep in mind I’m a virgin, I’ve never sexually touched a woman before, and I guess I’m worrying quite a lot about this: 

When a man is with a girl and he wants to perform PIV, how does he get an erection? 

1) I’m told by various sources that as a young man in his 20s, I should be able to get it up just by looking at a girl … I don’t think this has ever happened to me. 

2) I don’t know if this is true or not, but I heard from a lot of people that masturbating a lot causes you to condition yourself to only get erect by stroking yourself, which is why I’m not able to get one just by looking at a girl - is this true? If a woman stroking a man’s penis is normal to get him an erection, then I’d feel a lot better knowing this is how you’re supposed to get erect.

3) If I want to take Viagra as a one time confidence booster on my wedding night, then I should hide it from my wife and not let her know, since “she will be traumatised that her newly wed husband has to take medicine to get it up for her” - is this really true? I was planning on being open with my wife since I assumed communication and not hiding anything is healthy. 

Tl;dr Can I please just get an answer to the above 3 points and a comprehensive guide on how this all works and what a man and woman need to do to get the man ready for sex.



 Are you allowed to talk about sex before marriage?

Most people who wait till marriage are rock hard just holding hands with their fiancé. Does the idea of sex get you excited?

If you don’t masturbate and you are straight, the idea of sex should cross your mind similar to the idea of your favorite food when you’re hungry. 

If this isn’t the case, maybe you REALLY want to have that conversation with this woman before you get spiritually bound to her for life. [Emotional Support]"
"I (28m) went on a date over the weekend with this guy (25m). We had a great time, chemistry was electric ect. After dinner we ended up going back to my house and watched a show I was talking about and cuddled. Throughout the night he mentioned multiple times about wanting to see each other again, wanting to cook for me, wanted me to show him one of favourite shows, things along those lines. He left, said we should catch up again soon, and I messaged after he left saying had a great time, again he said he hopes to see me soon. Said I’d love to, hoping he’d follow up with a when you free but he just liked the message and didn’t hear from him at all since.

It’s only been a day, but I’m used to almost constant convo with people I’m interested in/interested in me. He works a lot, so know he is a busy guy. When should I reach out again?

"I'm (21F) generally not one of the best looking people out there. I've never get any attention when I'm out and about at all actually. Very tall and skinny. My goals in life are to become a rich cat lady. And it would be very cool to find someone I really like but I don't think that will happen in this day and age. But I know it's important to date while your young so that's what I attempt to do. So I start using the dating apps. However my dilemma is when I tell someone I know I am going on a date or I have a partner, it is almost as if it's a joke or I'm lying. And yes this could mean they could just be shocked and suprised in a good way. But when the guys I do talk to or date eventually leave for some else, maybe it's true. I feel embarrassed in way thinking after going through the process of dating. It kinda just proves the point of why are you going on dates bruh when you look like this. They are right.

"Yo so for the past month and a half I've been talking to this girl, we've been calling every night since day one and we've been on a couple dates that went well. The thing is, since maybe the beginning of this week, she's started getting dry on calls, up until now she'd talk for hours on end non-stop, but now im finding myself starting most of the conversations and they aren't lasting long. Should I try calling less like not every single day, ig 'absence makes the heart yearn', or should I try talking to her. Or should I just give up and start talking to someone else? First of all, the initial phase, the first couple of weeks or even up to 3 months, is often the moment things don't work out. I wouldn't invest that much, talk all the time, give that much attention to a girl, you have met a few times, a girl you know for a couple of weeks or months. Because, you don't know anything about her yet. And, as I said, that is often the stage where things break off again after just a few dates.

Furthermore, giving loads and loads of attention, talking daily, texting nonstop, talking on the phone for hours can quicky burn through an initial attraction. You soon become just a pan pal. And, you might have noticed, that a lot of women have a plethora of such 'guy friends'. Guys, and ppl at large, they talk to every day online or even offline.

And, you also wanna check if you survive the first couple of months with a girl to see if it and if she is even worth it to truly focus on her so much. Don't make chicks the center of your life, specially not right away. Overinvesting is often a good way to lose the attraction women initially had. Because, they experience that so often. 24/7. They basically drown in men's (sexual, or 'friendly') attention. Specially those women that are active on social media, insta and dating apps.

It also matters how you met a girl.

Women on dating apps are quite likely to not only talk to multiple men, but to meet and sleep with multiple men. If you 'approach' a woman online, e.g. on insta or match with her on tinder, then you have to assume, that she is talking to a variety of men, and most likely fucking at least one other guy on the side. So, to go full into the cliche: A woman active on insta and dating apps, preferably also tatts all over the body, and she likes to party and goes clubbing....

Let's just say, the probability that you will build anything serious with such a woman is low, to say it diplomatically.

And, a woman not (very) active on social media, is not on dating apps, has a private insta account, rather hangs out with 2 or 3 good friends and her family instead of going clubbing, has had maybe 1 to 3 long term boyfriends is potentially vastly more likely to focus on just one guy.

Hold your eyes open for that type of woman. The polite, friendly, humble, chill neighbor girl, no tatts, doesnt like partying, loves her family, doesn't fuck around and didnt jump from situationship to situationship and she knows she could get mass attentino from men online, but she doesn't want that and is looking for something more.

That's the type of woman you want, unless it is just sex. Then it doesn't matter, and then you prolly should focus on online dating, insta and clubs or nightlife in general. [Practical Advice]"
"Is it really as bad as it feels? I 'M35' have a girlfriend 'F30' . We've been together for 4 years, living together for 2, and we've got a 1-year-old daughter. She’s from another state, and we live here in X. Things ain't good between us anymore. Whenever I say something, share an idea, suggest we do something, or just talk in general, she talks down to me with a condescending and disrespectful tone. I've gotten mad, and she says I'm overreacting. I suggestd we go to therapy, but she says no, that I need to fix myself first. I don't feel much interest in her anymore 'cause she's so rude to me. Over the past 2 years, we've only been intimate 10 times, we don't do anything together, and she makes my work life harder. I work full-time and take care of our daughter in the afternoons since she neglects her 'cause she's stressed (she doesn't take care of her in the morning either; she convinced me to put her in daycare). I want to end the relationship, but I'm scared I won't see my daughter again, that she'll take her back to her home state or not let me see her. Is it really as bad as it seems to split up when you have a kid? Can y'all share your experiences with me?
 Depending on what state you live in, it’s against the law to remove the kid from some states. I would look up
Your state and see what the laws are. 

Most courts now are very friendly to both mom and dad having equal custody. Another thing to look up or make a call to an attorney and ask some general questions. 

I would say a healthy two parent home is always better than a split one. If you can’t make it healthy, than splitting and is probably the better way to go. 

I personally would meet with a divorce attorney and pay whatever thoeir consultation fee is and find out what is the most likely outcome if you divorce in your state. At least if you decide that is what you want to do you’ll have an idea of what can happen.  [Commentator's opinion]"
"Before you read the rest of my nonsense below- it’s all hypothetical of course it’s not like we’re actively dating and have ever discussed this ever, so how DO we discuss this?

She had not even a dust particle of reference to her child in any of her social media accounts. I ended up doing some digging last minute and figured out she has a kid. A part of me wants this date to go great.

 But worst case scenario if we like each other and want to take each other seriously, I’m worried she’ll want me to help raise her child. I legitimately cannot do that with my career goals and work schedule. I will also NEVER be a number one priority in this woman’s life until we die. It just doesn’t click. I don’t want to call the date off, but with the new anxiety I know I won’t be able to enjoy to my fullest.

Can anyone help me stop catastrophizing. This girl deserves me at my best, and someone that loves her and her child. But I’m 20 years old, I don’t know if she likes me at all and if we’ll ever end up even finishing the damn date, and me thinking like this makes me want to cancel on her, she liked me and seems stoked to hangout with me, Im just too much of a broke kid to even hand her kid a dollar. I hope you guys can see where I’m coming from, am I being unreasonable?

Another fact, I have no date experience this is my first damn date, I can’t call this off an a girl that wants ME, man this is painful. I’m mostly pissed at myself for not being able to give this girl my all regardless, fuck I wish I was rich fuck I wouldn’t even think twice  If you are not seeing yourself to be the dad or kids just don’t go further .

"So I have a friend that I've made it very clear from the beginning that we are just friends no sex, no dating, nothing other then friends. She has tried to seduce me on several occassions and even tho I keep telling her we will never be more then friends she refuses to accept it. 

  The reasons why I will not date her is simply because I can't have the life I want with her and I don't want to put her thru the heartbreak of dating me just for us to not work out and our friendship over. By the life I want I mean I want kids she can't have them due to being sterilized at a young age, we have none of the same hobbies and in fact she always gets mad when I'm doing my own thing and I don't answer her phone call, we have diffrent moral viewpoints on things and she always tells me I need to change my viewpoint because I'm just boring. 

She keeps getting irratated and going off on my GFs and my FWBs and then gets mad at me when i tell her she needs to stop doing that. She calls me crying because she just wants a good guy like me but it's not fair that I keep her in the friendzone. She tells me all the time that she can give me all that I want in life so how come I don't choose her. I point out all the reasons I've listed and she says that it's not fair. 

  We've never slept together only been friends. I've let her stay at my place before when she was homeless and she would be in my living room naked when I got home from work and get mad at me for not having sex with her. She would try to get in the shower with me and got angry that I wouldn't let her. She would try to get in my bed at night so I would go get a hotel room or sleep in my work truck since it has a bed on it.  

  I just don't know what to do anymore with her. It's just exhausting on top of everything else I have going on on my life right now. Any advice?? She's not listening to you and obviously not respecting your boundaries. Think it's time to put the friendship to an end. [Practical Advice]"
"My ex of 9months refollowed me on instagram and we chatted. We flirted too maybe some inappropriate flirting but he started it. I would say we both broke up with each other because we argued over and over. It was because he thought he was in the right and I did too but I always heard him out and tried to see why he felt a certain way which he didn’t do with me. We’re both 26. We didn’t talk at all for most of the break up it’s been 2 months and I never bugged him but I missed him and I thought maybe him too? He ghosted me four days later. I don’t know what I did? I didn’t pressure him into anything, not even to get back together he says he’s single and he asked me if I was single too I said yes but I didn’t pry into his life so idk why he ghosted me :( he hasn’t said a word to me since. I keep myself busy with my studies, my pets, learning to play the drums, going out more with my family, calling up friends more but him doing that made me really sad Plez any guy advice would help. I'm sorry but he was just taking the temperature to boost his ego by telling himself at least he wasn't the only one single. It was a petty vengeance from him. Sound you dodged a bullet. Block him and start to talking to other men. I bet you'll find someone better soon enough. [Practical Advice]"
"Does anyone else ever feel tired of working on your anxious attachment in dating? I have a really good life outside of dating. I have friends who I have really secure relationships with, I have a good bond with my family, I’m doing well at work, I often travel and explore new places. I’m very thankful for my life and the people in it, and dating feels like it sucks some of the happiness/ peace out of it. I always feel so much better when I take a step back because I hate how bad the anxiousness gets. I’m a lot better at regulating my feelings now, but sometimes, I get to know someone and it’s going well before they suddenly start pulling back, and by then I’m invested. So it hurts, but the anxiousness is so much worse than the pain. I know I can get over heartbreak but the way that anxiety feels? Absolutely horrible. I’ve been through therapy and I’m in a coaching programme now but it’s still hard going through the anxiety. 

I was dating for a year and a half, and I’ve stopped dating for a few weeks. Honestly, I think I’m happier now than I’ve been in months, which says a lot. I could have written your entire post. I constantly go through this cycle where being dumped, left on read, etc. shatters my self-esteem and turns my scars back into wounds, and then I have to spend like at least a year picking up the pieces. And during my break from dating, I eventually gain momentum and feel confident and happy again. And I think, “I’m really thriving and content with my life right now— it’d be nice to share it with someone. I’m finally ready.” And then by the time I find someone I’m compatible with, any doting gesture they make triggers my abandonment issues, but nevertheless, I hope. And I always hope hard. I almost have a “gambling addiction” when it comes to hope— I tend to go “all in.” And then after 3-4 months, my partner changes his mind— just like everyone else did before. And because I gambled every last hope I had, I lose everything… And then I’m back to square one, or even square negative 20 when it comes to my mental health. I’ll remember how much happier I was before I started trying to date again, and I’ll wonder if it was ever worth it to put myself out there in the first place. I am so much happier single, when I’m not fretting all the time about trying to keep a partner. I have dozens of friends, plenty of creative endeavors I’m excited about, and an amazing family. Why take all of that for granted by fixating on trying to find love that lasts?

It makes me wonder how I can actually know whether I’m mentally healthy enough or ready for a relationship… because ideally, I shouldn’t date until I’m at a place where my confidence is solid and grounded enough that it can’t be shaken by external factors. But how will I know when my self-esteem is sustainable enough to date again, if I’m always happier and more motivated when I’m single? [Not Relevant]"
"Hey everyone! First post on reddit for me so please be patient! I need your collective advice on a gift I can provide to my wife who's recently been going through a lot of challenging times (including personal and family related health concerns, sacrifices, anxiety attacks etc). Despite that, there's been some recent good news that have unfortunately taken a back seat due to the overwhelming other challenges (job promotion & graduation). 

  
Our living condition is currently long distance due to work, i'm looking for gift ideas I can send her remotely until we meet again. I want it to be something special and uplifting so that she doesn't feel alone or think that I don't care about her successes. 

- she doesn't like alcohol

- she likes jewelry but this would be a poor gift choice at the moment imo

-  she won't be consuming sweets or traveling due to health reasons

- assume budget is < $1000

  
Lastly, is there a preference on if i should wait until we meet in person in a couple months? I don't want her to wait that long before she feels love but i'm okay to give her a gift now and then another again when we meet.

  
Thank you all for reading and taking time to respond. Really appreciate it! I would surprise her with some meals delivered to her, and then when you see each other, have a fun filled or relaxing day planned with each other, at a spa or something. [Practical Advice]"
"I matched with a girl a little more than a month ago, and we hit it off quite nicely. I asked her out for a coffee date after some light conversation and she said that she wanted to focus on her exams and that we could go out later. I tried my best to keep in touch, but not to be overly aggressive. She’s never initiated any interactions, but is always kind and enthusiastic in responses. 
Last weekend I asked her out again since I knew her exams were over, but she said that she couldn’t because she was out of town. I responded that with “No worries. Hit me up when you’re free and we can figure something out”. Yet she never did. We talked a little since that conversation, and I don’t know what to do or what to say. I don’t know how to bring it up again without looking like I’m hounding her for a date.  She’s not interested, sorry. She’s giving you convenient excuses as a way to let you down easy. After you ask her out the second time imo it’s up to her to reach out if she wants to see you. Don’t waste your time with this girl until she decides to make a move. [Practical Advice]"

"A friend of mine has an OF. She asked me to help her with photos and videos, both taking them and editing them as she isn't tech savvy and doesn't have the equipment to do it or space to do it.

 I'm also currently getting into the dating world and I'm curious and concerned how much of an issue this will be for me. It's only solo stuff, I'm not involved in any way besides holding the camera. Full disclosure, we have never dated, nor had any romantic feelings between each other. We have hooked up before, but it was more of a fuck buddy type situation. No emotion besides she was in the mood. She doesn't pay me beyond either bringing lunch/dinner over or ordering it before or after the photoshoot. I've been helping her for over a year now, once or twice a month, so seeing naked isn't remotely a big deal. Outside of the times she was in the mood for more, things are very ""straight to business"" like. Almost clinical.

 I don't want to screw her by having to quit, but at the same time, I can understand this could be an issue for a lot of people and I don't want to miss out on finding someone because of it.

 So ladies of reddit, how big of a deal is this and when is the best time to bring it up with potential date? I'm not a cheater and would never consider it, but obviously me saying that means nothing to someone I just met.  Some women will mind about the onlyfans photos and regularly seeing an old fwb naked. Others won't mind. 

The women who object to onlyfans, have issues with jealousy of other females or can't calmly tolerate their bf regularly meeting up with an ex they use to have sex with- these are the types who will mind.  

It probably won't be a big deal for the women who have no problem with people making money from selling their nudes on onlyfans and no issues with the guys that they date staying friends with their past ons & fwbs.

I wouldn't mind a date or bf who takes onlyfans photos of a female platonic friend on an unpaid basis. Its the fwb history that would put me off, I don't get sexually involved with friends or relatives and I don't want much involvement with people that do. [Commentator's opinion]"
"My boyfriend was out with his friends the other day which an old friend came across to them and hung out for a while. He came home and let me know he invited him to his baby shower. Me and my bf share many mutuals so i know almost all of his friends. He told me that the baby shower is on 7/28, and also even mentioned the attire for this party. Which he claimed he has no idea what to wear. I felt a certain way because he didn’t even bother asking if i wanted to join him that day, and it’s not like i don’t know them. And i don’t want to bring anything up because i know he will say “He only invited me, and never mentioned to bring you” but it doesn’t hurt to ask. We’ve had many situations where he goes out and i get left behind. Goes to parties and never takes me anywhere. I don’t know i just need some advice. Should i just let it be? Or say something?  A baby shower is not the hill to die on and you shouldn't read into it. They aren't the same as parties or a night out. It is a celebration of the couple and their growing family. They are often very intimate and small. I've been to plenty where couples were invited and plenty where it was just the friend of the couple invited. Both are totally normal.

If there are other nights out/parties/or social gatherings where other partners are invited and you are not, that is the time to have the conversation. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I’m pretty new to dating and am not very experienced. I (26F) have been seeing a guy for like 6 dates and we still haven’t kissed yet. I feel like maybe he’s waiting for me to initiate and make the first move? Anyways, I have literally no idea how to do that. But we’re starting to feel more like friends, and I want to be more affectionate, especially to see how the chemistry is. For the guys out there, how would you like a girl to initiate the first kiss? You can always just ask him -- May I kiss you?  

Or If that feels too awkward, have you had any physical contact all all (hugging, cuddling, holding hands)?  In a hug, if you have one of your arms below his and the other above, just let that hand float up to the base of his neck.  I've found that having my hand there is a pretty reliable signal to a guy that I want him to lean down so that we can kiss. [Practical Advice]"
"GF 30 and me 30M, we've been together for almost 5 years. 

The first year was the sweetest. We were intimately active. We would naturally alternate who initiates the moment of intimacy. After moving in with her during the pandemic, things were slowing down but it was still fun. We were starting to shape our future; buy a house, adopt a dog. We both don't want kids. Travel

Then we moved in a bigger apartment. That was 3 years ago. We moved because the previous apartment was too small and there were a lot of ants infiltrating the out of shape building. It somewhat affected her morally. Whenever she sees an insect when we are walking outside, she freezes. The new apartment is a more recent building. We split the chores pretty much 50/50. I do dishes, clean the bathroom and outside the appartment. She does the laundry cleans the floor. We cook 50/50.

Since we moved to that apartment, I alway initiate the intimacy and she never does. For the last 2 years she started to study full time to finish university. She was doing that part time, but since I can financially support both of us, it was possible for her to go back full time.

Since she started studying full time, there's actually no intimacy at all in our relationship. She works part time over the weekend + school. So I get that she's tired. When she finished her last semester in april, I thought things might be acting up again, but it doesn't.

I already discussed about the lack of activity in our relationship. We tried to be more spontaneous, doesn't work. We tried to schedule a ""fun"" moment, when it's time, it's never the right moment.

I really love her but the lack of intimacy starts to tire me. What should I/we do next? Hi I'm 33f and my 8-year marriage didn't survive this. I can certainly help you with the perspective of the other person (obviously only to an extent because everyone is unique). I can definitely say what we did that didn't work, and I'm in a 2-year relationship now where things are going excellent in that department.

Here's what I've learned:

Quantity over quality: Never stop connecting with one another physically. Hold hands, give hugs, give each other little back scratches, and have the other person rest their head in your lap and play with their hair. Keep the lines of physical connection open, and always treat each interaction like you could stop there and it's good enough. The reason why is that at least in my experience my ex would take my openness for one type of physical connection (aka a back rub) as a full send to try and be intimate so eventually I turned down simple physical things because it usually meant I had to be down to have sex. And eventually the lack of physical touch made it even more difficult to connect and even get to that point.

Play - don't take things too seriously: Be OK with not every instance of being intimate ending with you or her finishing. Just have fun. The more positive interactions you two have the more confidence you build.

I don't have a cute name for this one: Umm, to be a woman is to perform a little.. I'm not saying faking it, but I am saying that we're all socialized to make it a bit more about you. So, it would go a long way to just help her feel comfortable enjoying it just for her. Confession time: my current boyfriend had to say that it was OK if I scrolled social media while he went down on me to break the cycle of intimacy feeling like a chore because I always felt pressure to ""make it sexy"". I promise it's not like that forever.

OK that's what I've got. Ymmv. I'm just really happy you're trying to find help so I gave it my best shot. [Practical Advice]"
"Been with her for a year and a half now, the first months of our relationship were full of lies around her drug use and other things. That’s in the past now we have since traveled the world together and have ALOT of great memory’s. 

Anyhow I still have trust issues around it and it makes me act slightly controlling which isn’t fair on her.   We went on a mini break because of this last week. 

During this mini break she’s had a 30 year old man sleep in the same bed with her. She tells me he is gay but I’ve never met him and she’s only met him like 3 times. He also is asking to borrow money of her.  Just screams bad news to me!

On top of this she wasn’t going to tell me I had to find out through her messages on Facebook. 

I love this girl dearly and don’t want to leave her as we have exiting things planned. We get on so we’ll our only downfall is the trust and her lack of honesty. Is it worth giving it another go after the many many I have.  Will she just continue to be dishonest and will I find myself in the same place a year down the line.?
 I think it is time to leave. A random 30 year old man sleeping in the same bed as her? And she never told you? Relationship started off with lies so I don’t think there’s much hope. I understand it’s hard but you’re still young and will meet other people. Not worth it to waste time being with somebody you can’t trust [Practical Advice]"
"Hello, so I rarely if ever post but need some advice. 
I met a man who is 14 years my senior (28f and 42m). We started talking and absolutely hit it off. We currently are long distance as we met while I was traveling for work. We have spent a few weekends together, and spend every evening talking for hours and throughout the day message or have short phone calls. We just click… he says things that align with my thinking and there’s no way for him to know how I think about those topics. 
Here’s the thing, he is halfway through a divorce and has two kids. Everything regarding the situation, that he’s told me about, has checked out so far. I have not met the kids, but one is excited to meet me, the other is more hesitant. My parents don’t love the situation, and I can understand why but they also have no interest in meeting him which would help explain things I believe. I don’t think there’s anyway for them to get it… I am just slightly lost. Is it really an impossible situation? Any advice? Thank you in advance!

"So yesterday I received a save the date for my childhood best friends (Anna) wedding. I was so excited! Only to open it and discover it is on the same exact day in October as my other close friends (Brenda) wedding, who I am a bridesmaid for. There is no way I can do both. And I definitely would not skip out on Brenda's wedding for any reason. 

I feel awful missing her wedding! Is there anything I could do instead? I don't have any extra money right now to throw her a shower or anything and I don't know who else is going. Anna and I aren't really close anymore but I will always love and support her. 

What are some ways I can tell her I can't make it to her wedding? And alternative things I could do? 

Tl;dr: childhood friend getting married same day as my other close friend. Already committed to my close friend and would rather go to her wedding anyway. How can I tell my childhood friend I can't make it and what is something I could do for her instead (that's inexpensive)? Get a photo frame engraved with their wedding date and send the gift closer to the wedding. They’re not super expensive and you have time to save up. You should be able to do that for under $50.

Just give her a call or send her a text and tell her that you’re super excited about her wedding and wish you could join to celebrate her special day but that you’re in a wedding that same day so won’t be able to attend. 

It happens. You can’t be in two places at once. [Practical Advice]"
"I don’t get it either y’all.

I’ve expressed wanting to move out multiple times with good reason, and everytime the conversation got shut down by him. 

Tomorrow I’m leaving for a trip and when I get back in 2 weeks, I’m set to move out. I tried to open up a conversation with him about it last night so he had time to think and process me moving out. He couldn’t really emphasize with any of my reasons for moving out, and stated that “You (me) living with me is a boundary.”

Which it’s not? Or maybe it is? I don’t really know. Anyways, I don’t know how to navigate this when everytime I bring up the topic, he shuts down (he gave me a 2 day silent treatment once) or doesn’t listen to any of my reasons.

NOTE: I realize my post wasn’t clear. He means that in our relationship, me living with him is a boundary - or better phrased, a “requirement” - for us being together. 

I just feel like I’m having to choose between my boyfriend and what I want to do. I want to move out, but I also love my boyfriend and want to stay with him :( I guess you move out single? [Sarcasm]"

"So I (27m) didn't expect to ever be in this situation, but here I am. I got out of a long relationship and recently started getting back into OLD. I had some dates that went nowhere, and a few days ago I went out with a girl that I had no expectation or intention of sleeping with on the first date at all. So much so that I didn't even bring a condom or anything since I was 100% sure nothing was going to happen (I did have some at home so we didn't do it unprotected, because I'm sure it'll come up). Our convo wasn't flirty or sexual at all, she seemed pretty shy, and even during the date there wasn't any physical contact.   
  
However, after the date we sat on a bench and ended up making out, after which she indicated she was down for more, so for some stupid reason I invited her to my place. Truth be told, I had issues performing as I guess I'm still not really over my ex. She was very understanding, and ended up sleeping over. I texted her the next day saying I had a good time and indicated I'd like to see her again, but as a few days went by I realized I'm really not ready for this, and that there was much of a spark at all. I think I just got caught up in the moment and made a dumb decision, and I've been feeling awful. I've never been in a situation where I didn't want to see the person again after having sex, and I could really use some help with how to best approach this. I'm fully aware that no matter what I'll end up looking a complete asshole, and that's totally justified, but I'd still like to be considerate in letting her know I don't plan to continue things. This was one of those situations where the ""I'm not ready for a relationship"" excuse is actually true, as evident by how bad my performance was in bed.

Anyone been in a similar situation? Any advice on what to say/not to say? I'd also love to hear from women on this, because I'm sure you've been on the receiving end and I'd like to avoid her feeling used as much as possible, though I know that's almost impossible now. I have been on the receiving end. Tbh I appreciated the guy's honesty, it only caught me by surprise because there were no warning signs that he was about to say that. He also said it more like ""I don't know if I want to continue things"" instead of ""I don't want to"", which in the moment left me thinking he might change his mind, so just be direct and straightforward with what you want to say. 
That was a few years ago and we still talk every now and then, we are both 100% over it and there are no resentments :) but I guess it depends on the people involved. The main thing is that you deliver your message correctly, you can't control her reaction. [Commentator's opinion]"

"Before instantly commenting any hate/such please read the context of the story.

Senior year of high school my good friend (we’ll call him Jack) started dating this girl (we’ll call her Kathy). During that time I got a lot closer with Jack to the point I would call him my best friend, as well as becoming good friends with Kathy as well. College comes, and Jack and I are going to the same uni while Kathy goes to community college. We remain close for ~2 years while he is still dating Kathy long distance. Later years Jack and I start to distance, both finding different fits for friends we associate with, but still hangout and such. 

Senior year of college, Jack breaks up with Kathy and puts me in that divorced parents kind of situation trying to split hanging out between the both of them. During this time I get a lot closer to to Kathy trying to help her through the break up, and we become best friends and learn that we are quite similar and compatible with each other. Both mine and Kathy’s friends/families have commented on how we would be great together and we’ve admitted to each other that we’ve thought about dating each other, I just don’t know if us pursuing a relationship is the best idea. You're a really fickle best friend, man [Hurtful]"
"It's almost comical what a high percentage of women go on a first date with me while sick, and then give me whatever they have by talking in my face in a loud restaurant.

The crazy thing is they think it's no big deal. They show up for the date and say stuff like i have been so sick this week, but don't worry I ""took a z-pac"" or ""I had an IV"". None if that even makes sense. They are still contagious.

"My (26F) boyfriend M (32M) has a work buddy named Vance. Earlier this week M told me about how Vance went to get a massage and at the end he got a hand job. Weird whatever good for him. Last night my boyfriend fell asleep on the couch and I was about to eat some ramen on the floor when his phone went off. Long story short I went through it (we have both done this before we have an open phone policy) I went through his messages between him and Vance and Vance texted him the address and picture of the place. Then said “Go get a tuggy tonight lol” 
M responded “lol I just might” 
Vance said “she had some soft hands”. 
And that’s was the end of that conversation. I’m 4 1/2 months pregnant with our second child. I’m seriously disgusted and so fucking hurt. I woke him up and tried talking about it calmly. And he freaked out on me saying “why are you going through my phone, you are crazy & get away from me” and went to the bedroom and fell asleep. I’ve been crying all night. I’ve only had like 3 hours of sleep. It’s 4am and he left for work. I don’t want to be with him anymore. I have no family or friends here and I’m on probation out here. I am a SAHM meaning I have nothing to my name. I could go to Arizona and live with my sister but I would never leave my son and honestly I wouldn’t want to take him away from M because most of the time he is a great dad. I know my emotions are higher than usual right now. But I’m done. We have had a lot of issues lately and I’m at the end of my rope. I’m going to call my p.o today and see what my options are if I even have any. I made a therapy appointment on Wednesday. I’m planning on telling him I don’t want to be with him anymore. My confidence is crushed and I just can’t trust him after this. Especially after he reacted when I confronted him. How hard would it have been to just say “it’s just guy talk etc”.

P.s the thing that bothers me the most is they work together. They talked about this at work. So then why did Vance send him the address and a picture of the place?  For me it could be guy talk… but the red flag is that he got immediately defensive. This shows that he’s aware that it’s wrong.

Contrast instant anger and denial with:  
“Ha ha. Yeah. Vance keeps going on about it, so I said that to shut him up. Now, are you going to give me that tuggie?” [Commentator's opinion]"
"Ok. Short story: I was “dating” someone. We talked about our relationships; this person was never brought up until I saw their picture pop up in the car on her phone. I stopped and immediately said I knew them; she asked… did you guys “fuck” I said yeah, uncomfortably. The rest of the car ride was chill, and I immediately regretted not saying anything. Then she told me they also had a fling and were just friends now. But it turns out they are best friends. We talked in the car, and she immediately told me she wanted to stay single and wasn’t ready to commit to anything serious. I understood that. 

 I was freaking head over heels after talking for a month and a half. I slowly distanced myself after a few hangs and told her I couldn’t shake the fact that you slept with the same person I slept with, and they're also now your best friend. She says that it’s a red flag that I felt that way. Am I the one in the wrong? How the fuck could I be. I don’t think either of us foresaw this, but it’s fucking insulting to say it’s my fault. Would you have done the same or kept trying to be friends? You were in this thing for six weeks, found out something that didn’t work for you, and you got out. It doesn’t really matter what anyone else thinks. I think having a connected sexual history would make a lot of people uncomfortable. 

One of my absolute closest friends is a straight guy (I’m a woman). It’s something that I always told people really soon after we start dating because, yeah, a lot of people feel uncomfortable with that situation. Better for everyone to get that information out there. I think it’s a rare thing to have a close guy friend where you don’t have sexual or romantic feelings. But that’s not even her situation since the two of them did have sex in the past. 

You’re not being controlling or jealous. This just isn’t for you. That’s okay. [Emotional Support]"
"I (22M) have been with my GF (21F) for over a year now. Everything in our relationship has been great, she’s just the best, loving, caring, incredibly cute, intelligent, for me, she’s the whole package. 

Last night we were getting intimate (it has been a long time since the last time we’ve been intimate due to her not feeling and tha situations not being appropriate), I was touching her over her pants and she seemed to enjoy it, so i asked if i could go underneath, she was hesistant at first but then said yes, I went at it but at a certain moment she told me to stop, here’s where i fucked up, I didn’t, I kept saying things like “are you sure you want me to stop?” , in the moment I thought she said beacuse my parents were home, so i did to sort of tease her and thinking that would make things spicier, she told me again and i stopped. This was out of character for me, and I recognize it, I don’t tend to break her boundaries but this time I did. We did some more stuff after I stopped touching her, and called it a night. 
The next day she commented to me that I hurt her (physically), I told her that I was really sorry, that i really didn’t mean to (which is true, I would never do anything to hurt her, she is the love of my life). She mentioned that she did told me to stop and I didn’t, which brought some memories of a past relationship she had were she was hurt in that way (way worse from what she has told me). I kept saying that I was really really sorry, that in no way I meant to disrespect her like that, that I got carried away (which is no excuse) and thought that it was because there were people in the house ( I know that no means no, that’s why i’m I frel so bad, and I’m angry at myself for not listening to her). She says that it’s fine, that she knows I didn’t mean to, that she told so that I don’t do something like this again. Even though she says this, I can’t help but feel like I lost her trust in regards of being intimate, she usually isn’t completely comfortable with these situations (she enjoys them, she like being intimate like that, but she says her past relationship may have caused some problems to her about that), I just don’t wanna be the same as the other dude. I want to gain her trust again so that she can still feel safe with me (regarding intimacy). Am i overthinking? Should I listen to her and believe that it’s fine? How can I build her trust back so that she can feel safe again (This is just something that I feel)? You made an honest mistake that a lot of men have made, I believe you’re overthinking this situation, she told you everything was fine so try to believe her and learn from your mistake, when she says stop next time do it.

"Hi everyone ! The most awkward thing and embarrassing thing happened. This is a new ""relationship"" of two months but I've known him for years since we were teens,now I'm 29F he is 32 M. Anyways we were play fighting and making jokes . He was teasing me and there was a plushy right next to me I grabbed it and playfully through it at him . Well I aimed bad and it fell on his hot tea which was right next to all his electronics ( his computer, laptop, sound system etc ). It fell all over his stuff plus on him. I literally didn't know what to do and he just got angry and rushed to his room. I started patting down the water with towels and he came with towels too and told me ""to stop I've done enough"". Then he played his laptop and the sound was all messed up . He got more angry and told me I should go . He walked me to my car and it was soo awkward and I felt so bad. I tried apologizing and he said "" I need more self control "". Well on my way home he texted me saying he can't even charge his phone. I responded to him apologizing and told him I would help him with damages. He didn't respond . The next day he liked my story on Instagram but didn't say anything . I texted him to follow up and just said I'm checking in . He gave me a dry response I responded and then he stopped . Well it's been four days since the incident and idk what to do . I feel so bad but it was an accident he was playing with me too . What should I do?

Tl,DR : I accidently dumped hot tea on boyfriends electronics and now hes not speaking to me . what to do ? OOOOOOOF. I literally covered my mouth with my hand reading this story. I feel your PAIN.

Hopefully, the initial anger subsides, especially since it was an accident and you’re clearly VERY sorry. You already apologized AND offered to help cover damages; you can’t turn back time to make the incident not happen.

Some people need apologies to happen in different ways. You already tried a sincere apology and you tried to make it right. Perhaps you could try admitting carelessness, and promising to be more aware in the future? Obviously, you did not do anything intentionally, and this was a total mistake, but you DID throw a stuffed animal in a room with hot liquid near electronics. (Do NOT bring up to him that that’s a foolish thing to do anyway; it’s best to just focus on ourselves in an apology, even if it’s not totally our fault.) 

I recommend checking out the “apology languages” to see other methods that might work. And honestly, you DO feel really bad. It WAS an accident. You are trying to make it right. If he still is sour with you after all that, a future with him might not be in the cards. [Emotional Support]"
"My boyfriend (23M) and I (22F) have been together, off & on, since we were 16. He's always said he's an ass guy & never been much interested in boobs but I've been wondering if he's just not attracted to mine. I'm 5'3, 115lbs, & have a nice ass but 32B/C boobs so they're like just proportional for my frame, maybe a tad small. He tells me he's attracted to them and he likes them but I feel like he just says that to not hurt my feelings. 

1. he just never grabs them, looks at them, mentions them, etc. I've walked by him topless many times & he wouldn't take a second glance
2. pretty much only showed appreciation/attraction to them when they looked bigger than usual
3. his normal compliment for them was ""they're a nice size for your body""
4. only thing he's said is a turn on for him about boobs is cleavage (something I never have) I even wore a push up bra for the first time, it didn't give me cleavage, & he didn't pay any attention to it
5. I think he got off to a girl w/ big boobs & cleavage on a show we were watching together 
6. solely watched anime as a teenager so I wonder if that shaped his preferences
7. his ex before we got back together was his first gf w/ big boobs & lost his virginity to her so I wonder if it awoken something in him

so is he fr just not much of a boob guy & im overthinking this or does it seem like he really only likes cleavage / big boobs? :/ Why are you so fixated on your boobs?

What's the rest of the relationship like?

Lol keep in mind that you don’t know this dude so being rejected by him isn’t really such a big deal. just be sure to set boundaries for yourself and remind yourself that you are worthy of love and that everyone you meet won’t be your cup of tea and that’s valid and okay [Emotional Support]"
"So my very new Bf (less than 2 months) went out to a concert with his guy friends. I knew that some of his mates were inviting their gfs to this concert, and I was a bit upset that I wasn’t even asked if I wanted to go along with him but understood why (don’t like the music and bc not the best place to first meet his mates). 

Anyway, he said he’d be a bit absent from texting, which was all good with me until he started continuously posting pictures and videos of the concert but all focused on this one particular girl that was right next to him (no one else was included, just this girl). Now I tried to hold it in to clarify with him in the morning who that was, but as more pictures of them doing selfies close together and tagging exclusively each other in posts I kind of freaked out a little on him… I called him and asked him to explain who it was. It turned out to be the girlfriend of one of his mates. He got angry at me and said I should’ve known despite the fact that I’ve never once seen, met or heard of this mate’s girlfriend. Also, the boyfriend was no where to be seen in any of these posts so I genuinely couldn’t have just known. 

I just am so upset that he was continuously posting this stuff, ignoring my message and not just giving me a heads up message to clarify who the girl was, all on top of the upset of him making it obvious that I wasn’t invited. It really felt like he left me in the dark to overthink. I’ve apologised for freaking out but he’s just been really nasty about it and I don’t know how to address my feelings properly to him? What should I be saying? If you've taken responsibility for actions and apologized and he is responding in a way that makes you uncomfortable cut your losses. [Emotional Support]"
"This may sound ridiculous to some people, but I have just never really been good at communicating. I am not good at small, talk, or asking questions or pretty much any type of communication. This is absolutely something that I know I need to grow in.

My wife said it would mean a lot to her if I asked her more questions. For example, “how was your day Or “what were you thinking about today?”

What are some other good questions that I can ask her to take an interest in her life and show her that I care?  You know when you were little and maybe you asked “why?” All the time? Thats basically what shes asking for but in an adult version, how was her day, she tells you x, you ask how she felt about x, she starts to vent, just agree with her and listen and eventually youll get invested enough where you start having questions (your “whys?”) and i think over time you do this more often and youll have deeper conversations so much more effortlessly. Just apply this to everything, i think as men we are so cool with just being and not really digging that we tend to not dig for our partner which is what we typically do when we’re first trying to be with them, ya know like you become more inquisitive cause its a new person, same thing with your spouse [Practical Advice]"
"New to Reddit so sorry if this is poorly written. Also apparently these stories sometimes end up in video and stuff, so I ask that if you see this story you don't use it in any internet content, or repost it or otherwise archive it. I just want to ask this question and then most likely delete it later. Thank you.

So my problem is exactly as the post title states. We've been seeing each other pretty frequently for around a year now, and we met and were friends for a bit before that. About two months into seeing each other he told me he has IBS, and from what I've gathered since then it seems to be pretty severe. We've had to cancel a couple meet ups before because he wasn't feeling well, or to end things early for the same reason. Sometimes when we meet up he ends up having to use the bathroom due to diarrhea, and he always cleans up immediately after and is incredibly apologetic, especially when we're at my place. This is where my question comes in.

A lot of the time he's really not feeling well afterwards, and sometimes he comes out exhausted and shaking. I feel really bad that he always cleans up after himself, and I wouldn't mind doing it at least sometimes or at least helping. I don't care if it's gross, if he's not feeling well it's the least I can do. The thing that makes things way more complicated is that we're friends with benefits, not formal romantic partners (although on my end at least I've definitely been catching feelings for a while now), and I don't want to make things too weird or awkward. He also has a lot of self worth type issues and I don't want to embarrass him or make him feel like I'm belittling him somehow. I just don't want him to have to feel like he needs to clean up the bathroom himself when he's already feeling awful.

We have a generally good relationship and are really good friends, we've been there for each other through a lot by now. I don't want to mess things up, I just want to help him out with this since I genuinely wouldn't mind doing so. Any advice would really help. That's really kind of you! As a person who has had some similar gastric issues, I would say to ask him if you can help afterwards but also be prepared to take his no for an answer. It IS embarassing and perhaps cleaning up gives him back a feeling of control that IBS can strip away. Good luck. [Emotional Support]"
"Hello, i'm on the verge of breaking up because of this and I need urgent advice.

College students, have been dating for almost two years. He does not plan or take initiative in many things

-When he will see me next time if we are in different states etc 

- Any dates, anniversaries, occasions, i have to choose the time, the place, the reservation 

- When his family came over to see him (they live very far), their rental car broke down and they couldn't drive to us to have dinner together. He thought ""it's okay I guess"" and didn't think it was weird although I talk to his siblings often and have talked with his family before. We come from traditional backgrounds where it is customary/respectful to meet a partner's family and he did not put a care into it. I had to organize with HIS best friend to drive up to them so we can all meet.

- I am the one planning where we are subleasing for housing etc

- Says he wants to stay in my state but has not applied to a single job and he is graduating in a few months (despite him having a 3.9 and being very smart)

- ""scared"" to tell his family he wants to move out (he's 21+) to my state and has been putting it off for a year. 

On the other hand he does not have malicious intentions and is not ""playing me"". I'm his first relationship, and he is sweet in all other aspects. When we had a rough time I told him he should talk to a therapist/coach about his defensiveness and he did in fact do so (but only after I asked, again not taking initiative.)

I am tired of telling him exactly what I want him to do and feeling like i need to micromanage this relationship. I grew up in a really rough atmosphere and I sometimes just want someone to take the reigns from me but I feel like it has become impossible. I legit sat down with him and told him what has he ever taken initiative for in this relationship and it was only a game he picked out for us to play once...

His reaction when I told him all of this is coming up with a reason for everything.

Why didnt you plan xyz: i didnt know i should, it was to early, i care for you in other ways etc...

I feel like even if he does change now it is only after i poured my heart out and stressed so much to get him to change You can’t drag a partner through life no matter how sweet they are.  [Commentator's opinion]"
"So, for context I have been seeing this guy for a month or so now who I am really into (I knew him before matching him on tinder, we went to the same school and have mutuals). We have spent every weekend together and a day through the week most weeks if we have time between work commitments etc. Whenever I see him I feel like infatuated with him, he's just everything I could ever ask for in a man, loads of common interests, he's handsome as fuck, funny and the butterflies and nerves kick in more than I've ever experienced.

I am normally not one for thinking before I speak but I just don't want to mess this up or come on too strong. I know he's still on bumble/tinder etc, I am not because after a week or 2 of continuously seeing/speaking to someone that I've clicked with, I'd rather put all my time into one person not multiple. I have no idea if he's still actively speaking to anyone else, nor do I feel like it's any of my business.

But this is where my conscience kicks in and makes me wonder when the right time is to bring up like exclusivity or whether that's even what he's after? 

I'm more than happy to just see where it goes and just spend as much time with him as possible but I'm use to men and the novelty wearing off as soon as they find a better option so I guess I'm just afraid of getting more wrapped up because I'm already feeling more things that I'd want to be at this point 🙈

Any advice, similar situations or constructive criticism will be appreciated 😅 Yall both need to have a talk about what it is that you want between y’all, communicate where you both are mentally so you can get an idea of where his head is at and so he knows where you are at. [Practical Advice]"

"A few weeks ago, I met a friend of friends at the university. We chatted a bit and got along well, and I suggested going for a drink sometime. We ran into each other again recently, and he suggested having lunch together on Friday. 

The fact that he accepted my proposal to meet one-on-one makes me think he might also be interested. But at the same time, the idea of lunch seems more like a friendly get-together than my initial proposal to go for a drink. 

Should I see this as a subtle way for him to let me know that it's purely a friendly meeting? It's possible sure, but I think it's always best not to read too deep between the lines. You're right in that a lunch can be seen more casually, but anything is possible. [Commentator's opinion]"
"Hello! I'm a younger guy thats wondering about good places to meet someone? I've never liked the idea of dating apps and I'm not a big fan of social media, but that just seems to be the way everyone meets now. I've also never been big on partying or the bar scene. I come from a small town and I'm very active within my community, but most of the people I meet through community service projects are much older than myself. I also have a couple of hobbies but I rarely meet girls through them, and it seems like the ones I do meet are in a relationship. I've been single for a little while now and I'm ready to meet someone, but  I just don't really know where to go. In my previous relationships I've always met girls through friends or family, and those situations always just happened naturally, but now I rarely meet anyone new like that.

"I was married for 7 years from 2012-2019. I was treated poorly in every aspect. Verbally abused pretty bad and controlled in alot of ways. But I was used to it and it was my normal and I thought it was normal.  After my divorce I  met some men casually. But it’s been two years since I’ve tried to get out there.

I finally got back out there and wow. I didn’t know this was the correct way to treat someone. He cares about things, my wants and dislike and genuinely takes me into consideration. He doesn’t yell or get mad or negate the way I feel. The way I cook, the way I do things he likes it and does not downgrade me. It seems like he actually really loves me.

Even sexually. He is always kissing me, holding my hand, touching my butt when he can when no one is near, kissing my neck, touching my leg when he’s driving, kissing everywhere and not trying to have sex every time. He just wants to be close to me and feel me. Not looking to have sex every single time and it feels good for him to want to want to just kiss me all around and enjoy it. He’s an amazing kisser and we just enjoy it together and touching each other.  Sounds like a great guy. I'm glad you're happy. Since you're not asking for advice I won't give any, and I hope the relationship continues to go well and progresses over time and it will be long term and everything that you want it to be.

"I 36/F have been dating 35/M for the last month but we have years knowing each other prior. Dates have been great, chemistry has been great. We have similar looks on life and for the future. 

However, he is not able to finish with me. Today I asked if he’s been able to finish with other women, that he may have been seeing the last month and he’s been able to. He feels like we may not be sexually compatible, but we get horny for each other every single time. He just doesn’t finish with me. 

This is the first time I’ve gone through this, most of my relationships in the past have been sexual leading. The main part of them is the sex. So I at least had that, but now it’s the first time someone can’t with me. He expresses he has feelings for me and we can spend a lot of time together but he just can’t cum with me. He’s not sure if he can get there with me but has these strong feelings for me too. 

I just feel very confused. My ego is a little hurt too. My self esteem feels off.

"
There’s always so much talk and support about being cheated on and infidelity from the viewpoint of the partner being cheated on. I never see much about the devastation of finding out you’re the other woman (or man) 
Being misled from the beginning, forming a bond that you now have to accept as fake. 
I, 34/F was dating “Nate” 32/M for about 1yr. 
I am now finding out that Nate was in a 4-year  relationship the whole time and his partner 33/F was even pregnant while we were intimate. 
I don’t know how to feel. I know I shouldn’t miss something that was never real or genuine, and I shouldn’t want someone like that. 
Still, the thought of them together, working it out, and him discarding me like nothing still hurts. I guess it’s natural when you thought you had something special with someone. And I truly loved him. Part of me wishes she’d leave because he doesn’t deserve to be in a relationship after doing that to me, but it’s not my call what another woman chooses to put up with. This was no casual fling or one night stand. I hate feeling like nothing, like they still have each other, their own family and I’m left with all the pain while he gets off unscathed. We have not spoken since I revealed that I know the truth and exposed him. I’m not surprised, that was just for context. It’s just an unfair situation that I don’t see talked about much. 
I just want to reiterate that I had no idea, and this is all coming out over a year later. I’d never willingly be the other woman and then cry about it. I didn’t know. *I know I shouldn’t miss something that was never real or genuine*

It was real and genuine. For you. And that's what matters. 

You didn't do anything wrong. He did. 

Just because he's incapable of empathy, has no respect or decency, doesn't have genuine feelings, and lied to and manipulated you, has no bearing on you or your character. 

I've been the woman who was cheated on, manipulated, lied to, and so many more horrible things by a man I was madly in love with, planning to marry, and who I found out, after years of being together, that he pretended to be sick with the same incurable illness that I have just to get me to talk to him and go on a date with him. 

There are predators in this world, and I'm so sorry you've met one. 

Don't drive yourself crazy thinking that he's some great guy to his girlfriend. Feel sorry for her. He trapped her with a baby, lies, and manipulations. She is a victim, too, whether she realizes it yet or not. He put her in the most vulnerable position a woman can ever be in. You don't know what he says to her, how he treats her, or what she knows about the real him. 

You've seen his true self. Thank God every single day that you did and that your life is saved from this man. 

Yes. Your heart hurts right now, and it should be because you're a loving, caring, mentally stable human being who actually feels things and has emotional intelligence. Your ex will never understand what that's like because he uses people to satisfy selfish, twisted needs, and when he's done with them, he throws them away like trash. 

Be thankful that you're not like him. 

Don't let this man win by making you bitter, turning your heart cold, or becoming someone you don't recognize. Learn, heal, and grow. Let this experience empower you and show you how strong you are.

(((Hugs))) [Emotional Support]"
"I recently graduated college. During college, I dated someone for about a year. We broke up 10 months ago, and ever since then I have thought of her very often. I think about her in passing at least once a day. We had some issues in our relationship, but I broke up with her over a specific situation.

A few months ago I met someone new (Let's call her Sue) and we began seeing each other, but have not labelled the relationship. She is everything I could want in a partner.

A few weeks ago, I received information about the situation my ex and I broke up over that made me realize that I was completely in the wrong. I had always felt regretful about ending the relationship, but that made it 10x worse. I reached out to her after a long period of no contact. She gave me some closure but was absolutely not interested in getting back together.

I was absolutely crushed. But things have been getting better, even if I still think about my ex a lot. Meanwhile, things have been getting more serious with Sue and she has been hinting she wants our relationship to be official soon.

I have feelings for Sue, but I also have a lot of regret for ending my relationship with my ex. I know the right thing to do is to break things off, but it feels dumb to do so when Sue has treated me super well and is someone that I would want to date. Just be open and honest, you need to fully let go before dragging someone else into your life which you don’t feel 100% certain with. Don’t waste Sue’s time. [Practical Advice]"
"I’ve 35M been seeing this woman 50F for almost 2 years. It’s been great so far, she takes very good care of me, our place we live in together and cooks for us almost every night. I also cook for myself a lot too as I eat a lot. She does most of the housework and I will admit I should be putting in more effort towards these chores. About a month ago she started giving me the silent treatment after an argument, in the argument I ended up getting a bit stern and told her it’s very rude to ignore someone in the middle of conversation thus the silient treatment starting. 

She went to work the next day and wouldn’t allow me to pick her up, I believe she skipped work and went and gambled her money away somewhere as I could hear wind in the phone like she was waiting outside for the bus somewhere. We had a long phone call where she said basically nothing as I repeatedly asked where she was and if she was coming home(4pm)  I ended up staying up till midnight that night waiting for her and when I finally gave up and went to bed she was there sleeping already. I didn’t get home until about 8pm that night so there is a chance she was there the whole time or she snuck in while I was cooking. This was a few months ago. The next day she was fine and over it as was i. 

Two days ago she admitted to recently  gambling all of her money away and wouldn’t tell me how much, I’m guessing 3-6k. She stated she wouldn’t have her share of rent money (800) and needed to borrow 900 to send home to her family. I told her if we went and signed out of the casinos for two years together I would do it. Then yesterday she did the same thing as last time, wouldn’t let me pick her up and on the phone I could hear wind. Saying she would stay at work and work the next day, which is usually her day off. I asked her if she’s staying there forever and she said maybe. She wouldn’t tell me anything. I asked what I did to deserve this and she went silent. This morning she texts me good morning as if nothing is wrong to which I replied with ( …… ) 

How do I navigate my partners addiction, im not going to break up with her in her critical condition right now but how much can a guy take ? I know people need their personal time but can’t I be given some sort of explanation ? How many red flags do you guys see here, maybe it’s time I find someone my own age, I have no one to talk to about this, looking for honest opinions as I’m wracking my brain trying to figure this out. Thanks in advance.  Holy shit. This reads like she's more ur mommy then ur partner.  She takes very good care of u? This woman's 15 yrs older than u and is running off to gamble? Bro what are u doing. [Hurtful]"
"My aunt reached out to me and my sister the other day, and asked us if we were free to hang out with her and some of our cousins. We said yes. These plans came up while talking to my mom, who got upset and said that my sister and I were not allowed to go (she said things like, “if you don’t go you don’t love or respect me”) and actually forbade us from going. 

Back story: apparently on the last trip my parents took a few months ago, my aunt made plans with my other aunts (her siblings) and did not invite my parents. I believe my aunt told my other aunts to not mention it to my parents. My mom was hurt and to my understanding is in an unspoken fight with my aunt.

My mom also said that my aunt was not invited to MY wedding next year, and that if my aunt attends she will not go to my wedding. My mom pulled a similar stunt at my sibling’s wedding years ago, and threatened to not attend that wedding the night before.

I’m writing this because I don’t know what to do and I’m really starting to get annoyed with getting caught in the middle of family drama. It’s isolating and in my opinion life is too short to latch onto negativity. I feel like if I don’t put my foot down now, it’s going to enable this authoritarian type relationship. If I do put my foot down, I risk shattering my relationship with my mom.

I’m an adult, I don’t live in her house, I have a full time job. I have mostly always listened to my mom for small things to keep the peace because I do feel she feels the need to be in control and in charge, but as I’m getting older her attempts to control me and my decisions are annoying, immature, and tiring. I do feel like she treats me and my siblings as pawns and as an extension of herself rather than our individual selves sometimes; I know she loves and cares about us but she pulls these stunts sometimes and it is emotionally and mentally tiring. I do love her and care about her, but I know her personality and our relationship is complex.

Should I give in and listen to her or put my foot down? YOU'RE 28 YEARS OLD. [Commentator's opinion]"

When the end of the week approached and he hadn’t asked I broached the subject and he said he didn’t want to suggest a date in case he had to cancel as he’s quite busy and he probably won’t be able to arrange anything for a month. 
Am I wrong to feel that he’s not that into me as surely he could spare an hour for a coffee date in that time  yeah when i hear that line from women (these are women with no kids ) who say they wont be available for the next few weeks, i dont really take them too seriously. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I’m a 33F Asian ‘happily’ married to a 33M Asian. We have been dating for about 7 years prior to marriage.

My husband has been really amazing. He really loves me (kisses me, hugs me, tells me he loves me very frequently, irons my clothes, does laundry, cleans the house). He is also good looking. I mean he is literally everything you can ask for in a man except for when it comes to sex! 

I am a very open minded person, I assumed we never had sex before marriage as he respected our culture. Unfortunately it has been a sexless marriage for the past 5 years. 

Initially I’ve been extremely frustrated but shy to bring this issue up. The one time I confronted him, it became an argument and quickly made me feel like I’m not cultured enough for bringing this topic up. He even said at multiple occasions that marriage is not about sex. He gave multiple reasons for refusal- claiming he feels extremely ticklish & he does not know what to do (PS he works under healthcare). The most we have done is kiss. Whenever I touch him further he pushes me away saying he is ticklish. And if I go further he says I’m purposely doing it knowing that he can’t take it. We have never even seen each other naked. And honestly whatever love that I had for him has been wearing off. I can’t even recall when I last initiated kissing him because I know that it’s not going to become anything more intimate. 

Most of the time I’m just wondering if he is gay. I’ve confronted him once about it and it pissed him off. And there was once he said it’s because we are not ready to have kids. I mean how dumb can a person be to know that having sex is not equal to wanting to have kids now. Also being an Asian, his mother has been bugging me on when I’m going to give her grandkids. 

I’ve been focusing on my career and let this past trying to not let it haunt me. However it is getting more and more frustrating as I am a very sensual person. I do not know how to bring it up anymore as everytime I talk about it, the isn’t any conclusion. I mean it’s been so many years, anyone else would have left the relationship. I don’t even know why I’m staying- like I said except for absence of sex; he is really a gem. 

What should I do? I pretty much know communication is the key solution; but it is so hard to communicate about this.  He's either gay, asexual, not attracted to you, or has some serious trauma he has not addressed.

At this point you just need to sit down with him and say explicitly, ""I am not happy in a sexless relationship. We need to talk about why you don't want to have sex with me and if that is ever going to change."" I know it's hard but it's literally the only way you're going to get a clear answer. Don't let him deflect or refuse to discuss it.

If he absolutely WILL NOT talk about it or he claims he'll try but nothing changes, that is his answer. No shame in ending a marriage with no intimacy. [Practical Advice]"
"Hey everyone, Well this is my first time posting on Reddit.

Well I(21F) met this guy(21M) through a mutual friend, and it's been only three days since we started talking to each other and we haven't met in real life yet. On the first day of texting, he kinda seemed nice and sweet, but out of nowhere he asked me if I could be his forever and if we could make this journey together to which I told him that we should slow down as I didn't want to rush things up.

And after just two days, he texted me that he loves me a lot, misses me, and wants me so badly which made me feel a bit uncomfortable. We are not even officially dating yet, and he's already asking if I would leave him by any chance. 

This really made me feel a bit uncomfortable. Is this normal, or am I right to feel uneasy about this situation? Is it a red flag?

Thanks for your advice! Yes red flag [Commentator's opinion]"
"My boyfriend is currently on a family vacation to a place I’ve longed to visit for years. We’ve been together for nearly a year now, and he’s told me serval times how much he doesn’t enjoy going on family vacations and in fact, hardly ever does. This time around I was told he’s being forced to go as his mom booked his flight for him, and like idk. That genuinely pissed me off. I guess I’m jealous? His family is very close knit and come from a well off place, whereas I’ve got no siblings, don’t speak to my aunts or uncles and cousins, absent father, etc. and have always been very lower class. I’ve been busting my ass for years to get to where I can take vacations out of the country for myself, but with inflation and everything going on now it’s very hard. 

Anyway, I just I don’t know how to feel. The family always invites his sibling’s partner and they go on family vacations, but I didn’t get so little as an invite which has me wondering if I’m even liked by the family, or they just know I can’t afford it. (Idk which hurts most lol) and then I guess I’m just fucking jealous. My boyfriend wasn’t happy to go which made me more angry cause he sounded so fucking entitled. God forbid he has to go on an all paid vacation with a loving family to a GORGEOUS place on this planet, you know? 

I’m trying to be my normal loving self to him and talk to him like normal. He says he misses me while he’s out there and is telling me that he will do his best to send me pictures and stuff to make me feel like I’m there with him, and while it’s sweet and so considerate of him it makes me more angry. 

What should I do? How can I be pretend to be fine and message him like normal when deep down I’m VERY unhappy? I love this man with my whole entire heart, and wish him the best. I genuinely want him to have fun and enjoy his time out there, he deserves it. What can I say or do to not ruin his trip? I don’t want to show him how I’m feeling cause it’s not fair to him. 

(For the record, yes I spoke to him about this months ago when it got planned. I told him I was jealous and angry and apologized to him for feeling that way. He was super understanding and got my point of view and I thought that was that. But now that it’s here, now that it’s actually happening and he’s there, everything flooded back.) TIA You seem to understand that your boyfriend is not in the wrong which is already one step in the right direction. Oftentimes, Redditors look at the situation from an ideal perspective and expect you to be healthiest version of yourself, but at the end of the day, we're all just humans and need some constructive - rather than destructive - advice. I also face this problem in my relationship, and I'm sure a lot of people on here have. Don't worry, you're not alone. A good way with working through jealously, especially in a relationship, is by keeping yourself occupied and forcing yourself not to fall into the trap of self-pity. You are also gifted and blessed in many ways, it's just harder to see this when the people around you seem to have it better. God knows how boring these family vacations might be for your boyfriend or maybe his family criticizes him or there is obvious favoritism - there are several reasons why your boyfriend may hate this trip and if you were in his exact position, you would probably hate it too. Grass is always greener on the other side - staying busy will help you only focus on your grass!

  
Likewise, it's always important to communicate your feelings to your partner so that they are more understanding of you and open communication is always important. Obviously don't make it his problem, but if he is truly understanding (as you said he is), he will help you feel better! 

I hope you work through this! [Emotional Support]"
"So, I’ve(M18) recently come to terms with the fact that despite my best attempts, i’m definitely a nerd, and i enjoy being a nerd. 

With that realization has come the epiphany that i really like nerdy girls, too. My question is this: Where do I find nerdy girls?? There’s no dating app (no stealing my idea 😡), and the only place that we nerds gather is in virtual spaces (most of the time, anyways). 

If nobody else has any ideas, I’m just going to start wearing a Gojo costume into anime conventions (i’ve never watched jjk). I am sorry, I don't have enough experience to help you out here, I used to be very social, but this anti-social culture has taken its toll. 

  
I just want to tell you, great job on being yourself, never change. I hope everything works out for you! that last idea you have doesn't seem that bad tbh, women love Gojo lmao. [Emotional Support]"
"Hi! :) 
I’m 25 F, and I have had the worst luck trying to find a partner. I have had one serious relationship (3 1/2 years) which ended a year ago. I really only use dating apps (Tinder, Hinge, Bumble) because going out is hard for me since I have bad anxiety and not many friends. The last three or four guys I’ve talked to have ghosted me or had started texting less and less until it was nothing. I don’t think I’m too bad looking, I have a stable job, my own place, I think I have a good personality, kind of funny, and I’m very independent. I just don’t understand what I’m doing wrong or how I can fix it. I’m getting super discouraged and would like any advice anyone can give! I’m not desperate, but I really just want someone to start settling down with and give love to (which might sound weird or stupid lol). Again, any advice would be appreciated! Thanks for reading :)  Why did your serious relationship end? [Not Relevant]"
"I live in an apartment building, where lots of people get along and approaching neighbours isn't unusual. Some people go for a smoke together etc. I have had few chats with like, 3 people I think. One of them has knocked on my door asking for a matches, for example.

So few days ago in the evening there is a knock and I assume it's someone asking for a salt or something like that. Opened the door and there is a guy I have talked to briefly twice I think. Absolutely nothing flirty or sexual, not even close.

Without any intro, he asked if I want to have sex. I am very reserved and introverted and tend to get into freeze mode when I'm shocked. So I just stared and he kept saying something. Finally I managed to say that I don't do that, I don't sleep with strangers. I mean, yes, I could have said no and slammed the door shut, but that is what my brain thought is appropriate to say. He sayd something else and I think he said he would go for a wash and come back later. Again, I just stood there, trying to understand what the heck is going on. He left and I closed my door. Tbh, I was quite shocked. 

He actually came back, several times to knock. I said nothing, just hoped he would leave. 

I will see him again, he lives here too. What can I say the next time I see him? I find it very difficult to talk to people and only do it if someone approaches me in a friendly and safe manner. 

I want to make sure he gets the message that this question was extremely inappropriate, harassing and I am not interested. 

Tldr. Neighbour I don't know very well knocked on my door and asked if I want have sex. I panicked, he left. What to say hi when I see him next time, so he would understand this is unwanted.  This is extremely inappropriate, I’m so sorry this happened to you. I dealt with a similar situation and here’s what I did. Alerted the property/ leasing manager immediately. He has probably done this to other women. Delivered a written letter under the guys door saying that was inappropriate, unwarranted, and told him to never speak a word to me again. I told him if he passed me in the hall, just ignore me. No words are to be exchanged. Idk what warrants a police report - in my situation there was nothing I could report. But this was effective for me. He never spoke to me again. Consider moving if he doesn’t leave you alone. Nothing more important than your safety [Practical Advice]"

"I have a friend who said hes coming to visit my area and asked to meet up twice as i said the first time i would think about it, i said yes and he  asked me if i would like to watch all the Harry Potter movies together then asked if ild like to watch all of them with him.
I dont think he sees me as more then a friend so thats not it as he mentioned liking someone else. honestly just sounds like he wants to netflix and chill with you 

in the majority of cases when you think a guy see's you just as a friend he's just being scummy and acting that way so he can find an in with you 

not so weird asking if you want to watch 1 movie you both enjoy together.. 8 is a bit much that's like a 20 hour commitment 

but hey maybe he just really loves harry potter idk the guy [Commentator's opinion]"
"Okay, so my boyfriend and I come from really different backgrounds. I’m a European Muslim ‘23F’ he’s a Caribbean Catholic ‘23M’. We’re both from New York City. We have been together for 3 years. 

The women he’s dated before me have all been petite, Hispanic women with tattoos and long black hair. 

I ‘23F’ am a tall, pale white woman with short brown hair. 

His instagram following has always been women that are “his type” even though he’s always denied having a type. 

One time I asked him what made his ex girlfriend more attractive than me and he said “I mean you’re both pretty but she’s short and Colombian” and that made me feel really insecure. He has also said similar things to this in the past. For example: he once said he watches mainly Latina porn (then took it back and said he was just joking) 

It was months ago and it makes me wanna cry every time I think about it. I can’t mention it to him anymore because I’ve already brought it up so many times and he always says “I didn’t mean it like that” 

I do know he loves me but I think he fell in love with my personality. I don’t think I’m his “dream girl” if that makes sense. It kinda makes me hate everything about myself. I’ve started growing out my hair to be long, dying it jet black, got lip fillers, started going to the gym more, dress different than I normally do, got small tattoos and piercings. He does try to reassure me that he loves me for who I am. But it just doesn’t feel that way. 

If I walked into a room with all his former girlfriends, I know he wouldn’t pick me. 

He 23M keeps denying having a type but it drives me crazy because I know he does and I know I am not his type. I feel more insecure than ever. I’ve even started changing my appearance.  How to resolve this ?  I was taught a valuable lesson at 40 yrs old... I was single after 20 yrs of being married. I learned to navigate the dating apps, in my opinion, that they are not a good way to meet people.. However, if it wasn't for POF, I wouldn't be married.

I've known my husband for over 35 yrs. We both had long marriages, then divorced... I actually made his wedding cake when he got married. We kept in touch until our 30s. 

I came across his profile on POF... I thought cool! We can be each other's wingman or he has single friends. I invited him to hang out. He was sooo not my type. Sleeve tattoos, ears pierced, shaved head, hard working blue collar worker. He had a mohawk in one photo, and his user name had 420... I thought he was some stoner guy... even though I smoke cannabis, I was a hypocrite. It turns out he is exactly my type. We love the same things and have the same hobbies. He makes excellent money, and his bday is 420... he doesn't smoke and smells so good to me, I want to bite him. There is no such thing as a ""type""... you're judging others stereotypically and not as individuals. 

You need to focus on your self-respect, not comparing yourself to women you know nothing about. How many girls have you met that are beautiful... but really awful on the inside? How many girls do you know that aren't conventionally beautiful but are so beautiful on the inside that you look past any flaws. You have to love yourself before you can truly be loved by someone else. Know your value and that you have a hell of a lot more to offer than a few tattoos and dyed hair. [Emotional Support]"
"Just so we are clear it's not her V that smells bad. It's a actually odorless and I love to go down.


But for some reason while we are having sex her bedsheet smell kind of like my armpit after a long day. I have also noticed her clothes smell like this as well. She is from a third world country so I'm not sure if maybe it's what they use to wash their clothes, or maybe it's all the Nair she applies to her whole body... which I know for a fact can make sweat smell like sulfur.

Is there a polite way of pointing this out because I think she is unaware.

I really do love her though. 

And just for context I'm from a third world as well. It's just that she is fresh off the boat if you know what I mean. Sounds like Nair is the culprit. [Not Relevant]"
"so I met this girl at a convenient store, we kinda liked each other first glance and I decided to give it a shot and it worked, we texted a lot but due to my social awkward, I rarely spoke XD, we meetup at cafe net but I rarely talk, so I man up and ask her like if she would like to grab some snack outside but she said no, I shocked for a bit and decide to go out and eat sth myself cuz shit was so awkward if some1 doesn't talk, the moment I return she was already gone XDDD, should I ask her to go to the movie next time sure. it probably won’t work though [Sarcasm]"
"Hi, me 23F have been dating my bf 23M for 5 years now. Recently, everything has been great and I was prepared to move in together until I finally learned the truth. At the beginning of our relationship, he cheated on me with his ex who at the time was 23F and he was 18M. For years, I alway had my doubts but he made me believe nothing happened between them. He was still in love with his ex and talking to her almost daily the first two years of our relationship Whenever I asked if he ever cheated the answer was always ""why don't you trust me? Why would I ever cheat on you?"" We've been through so much together and I wholeheartedly love him but I'm stuck. Do i break up with the man who has lied and manipulated me these past 5 years? Or should I stick around hoping he'll change and we can move last this?  This was probably the third biggest lie I have encountered in the relationship but I'm holding onto hope and the love I have for him. I don't have anyone in my personal life to talk to about this so any advance is helpful. Thank you

"I´m very confused right now. I hooked up with a guy for several years. Weeks ago I asked him if it could lead to more than this and I told him that I wanted more than this and explained that I have feelings for him. He was very vague when it came to an answer, but our contact was dead after that. We didn´t text anymore, nothing.

I was okay with it and started dating again. I found a serious guy and things are going well, we went on  a few dates and he is looking for a long term relationship. My ex fwb must have heard about him, idk. But he texted me tonight..asking if we can talk. He regrets the things he said and is open to more.

What do I need to do now? This can't be true. Is it normal to change your mind when you find out she is dating someone else???

The new guy is serious and safe (but I was more into my ex fwb). With my ex fwb I'm feeling like, what can I expect now again (while tbh I'm head over heels about him). I would like to explore things more serious with my fwb.

Advice about this please. Has anyone ever been in such a situation? Or has anyone ever been like my ex fwb? [deleted] [Not Relevant]"

"I hope this doesn't come off as shallow. I've been married to my wife for over 20 years. We have one kid that's in college. When we were first married my wife and I enjoyed working out together, we hiked and biked and were very active. When my son was born, we continued to be active and still exercised together.

About 5 years ago she stopped exercising and doing anything active. Since then, she has gained over 45 lbs. and has really let herself go. She doesn't wear any makeup anymore and even her hair is always a mess. She even refuses to shower, when it's obvious that she should.

I thought at first it was depression, and we went to a couple doctors, and she insists it isn't depression and the doctors agreed with her. She insists she just doesn't care about her appearance anymore. She doesn't ever wear anything attractive, even if we go out for dinner or on a date. 

The problem is I do care about appearance. I take care of myself physically and dress appropriately. I feel nothing for her physically and we never have sex, because I was always the initiator. 

I've tried to get her to exercise, and she doesn't want to. We tried hiking and because she is so out of shape she turned around after 15 minutes. I don't know what to do. I'm too young to live in a marriage where my partner doesn't care about appearance or sex.  Has she had her hormone levels checked? Maybe its perimenopause. You should gently suggest that she speak with her Ob/Gyn about it since HRT can help with mood and energy, and help keep aging bone strong. Frame it around health and longevity rather than appearance. [Practical Advice]"
"So for some background about me, I’ve only had two relationships previously, both long term that lasted 4+ years. 
The first one was typical school dating, holding hands and first kisses. 
The second one was much more serious, we were each others first everything. It was a really deep relationship that sort of abruptly ended about 8 months ago. 

My current boyfriend and I have been dating for nearly 2 months. He’s the sweetest, most understanding, loyal, loving and selfless person I’ve ever met. We just clicked out of nowhere and have been attached since, despite still working through our own issues. 

I never thought I was the insecure type until I started dating him however, he’s told me all about his past relationships and can go on and on about crazy sex stories or drug stories. 

Honestly, it makes me feel a little insecure that he’s had so many more partners than me, and so much more life experience. Like, i don’t judge him..and he doesn’t compare me to any of his ex’s, or even talk about them unless brought up. 

But a part of me feels like I’m in a competition. I feel embarrassed that he’s a lot of my firsts and I’m none of his. I’m just looking for advice on how to get over this weird feeling. 

TDRL: bf has way more life experience and I feel embarrassed that I don’t and can’t give him the same feelings he gives me It’s only been 2 months. Just remember the way he speaks about his past is how he will speak about you. You feel that way for a reason you are trying you protect yourself but you refuse to listen to yourself.

"I’m 26 (M), the girl I’m dating is 23 (F). I’ve been talking to this girl for about six months told me that she deleted her Instagram and deactivated it. I ended up finding out that she still has her Instagram and I just assumed that she probably just deleted the app and doesn’t use it anymore. Then I see that later on she still has one and is active on it because she recently followed somebody around two hours after she told me that she doesn’t have one. I honestly don’t know why she would lie to me. I have never once said anything about her having one or not and it obviously would not be an issue for me if she did. So I asked her again the next day if she really doesn’t have one just to be sure. She again told me she deactivated it. She blatantly lied to my face. I haven’t confronted her on it but I really don’t know what to do in this situation. What would be the reasons she would lie about this? And what would be the best way to go about this situation?

"I’ve been seeing a girl for nearly 3 months now. We see eachother a lot, maybe abit to much but all in all it’s going well enough. But i’m not starting to wonder if i want anything to do with her anymore. I feel recently she has done a few things to set of my red flag alarms, little things like taking her phone to very short bathroom trips, being quite cheeky and combative humor wise, she told me the other day at my house she was going home to get a shower and grab her work uniform for the next day, she returned over an hour later with no uniform, didn’t smell like she had a shower and my gut just screamed she’s lying, another one if quickly pocketing her phone when she saw me appear one day, then shortly after when she went to use it again she got up and stood facing me which again sent major flags off. I’ve been cheated on before and i feel she had a lot of cheating vibes about her. She tells me she loves me & wants to hook a holiday together for september, but im seriously suspicious she’s seeing someone else. I got with her just as she got out of a relationship, but she said she had mentally checked out off it long before she emded it. I just feel like im being cheated on, seeing signs of it anyway. abit paranoid. on top of all this she always seems very distant, not very talkative sometimes, and just the lights are on but nobody is home type of vibe. I don’t know what to do but i feel very uncomfortable  She’s probably cheating. Your gut is almost always right. Been there. She was cheating. Oh yeah and the other one. She was cheating.

"I have a history with disordered eating. My husband recently has become very healthy in terms of food choices. He started only eating one meal a day about a year ago. He now wants to give up refined sugar completely (no dessert, no fruit, no bread, no pasta) and only eat whole grains, protein, and vegetables. He wants us to optimize our health and set similar rules for our young children.

I thought I had finally reached a point where I am comfortable with my own food choices and enjoying things in moderation. While I do sometimes overindulge with dessert, I no longer binge or hide food or other bad habits. The recent conversations around food have been extremely triggering. We are constantly talking about food and I am constantly feeling guilty about my choices and what I am doing to our children. I feel like a failure that I am not able to give up sugar, or more accurately that I do not want to give up sugar. I am extremely angry with my husband and resentful that he is harping on this topic every time we have a second to talk.

While I agree somewhat with him about reducing our sugar intake, I feel he is too extreme. I am super depressed that we have so little in common around food. One of my hobbies is baking and the fact that I can no longer do that for my family to enjoy is also super depressing and another source of resentment. My husband insists I need to just stop eating emotionally and we will be in alignment.

If it was just the two of us, I would be able to do my own thing but we are struggling to be consistent with our children. How do we move forward? Your husband is also exhibiting disordered eating, and will likely deny it. His hyper-controlled approach to food is not healthy for children at all, and puts them at high risk for eating disorders. 

I wonder if a “neutral expert” could persuade him, your pediatrician, or a pediatric dietician. [Commentator's opinion]"
"My fiancée (28F) is a first generation French immigrant who moved to the US for college 10 years ago and became a US citizen 4 years ago. 

Her parents and grandparents all still live in France and she visits them a few times a year. I went with her on a trip to France after we got engaged and had been together for a yea  to see and be introduced to her family. The entire time it was tense and hostile.

I guess my Fiancée didn’t tell her family that I was black because I could just tell by their face that they weren’t expecting it when they first saw me. She didn't send them pictures or anything of me. Her grandparents especially (who are in their 80’s and 90’s) kept making comments in French that I couldn’t understand but I knew were bad since my fiancée would respond in an aggressive/defensive way in French whenever they would make them.

Once we got back we had a discussion about the whole thing and she told me that her family is very proud of their country and its culture/history. They apparently have a bad impression of black Americans as lazy criminals or something (she didn’t say that directly but kinda referenced it) and apparently my girlfriend got an angry email from her father about a week after we got back that she “might as well sterilize herself” because she’s ending her bloodline. I even put it in google translate to make sure that’s what it said.

I kinda understand now why she didn’t tell them about me or send them pictures, but I don’t know how this will work in the future if we actually get married. How did I go about this?

 The real question is how is your Fiancée handling her racist family? It’s not great she didn’t prepare you in advance. Does she plan to keep contact? How much contact? [Commentator's opinion]"
"My boyfriend and I have been together for about 2 years now and I've noticed that he never really seems interested in me sending him nudes. For example, I sent him a couple of pics yesterday after I showered and he just sent a heart emoji and thats it. He didn't screenshot or anything like that either.

I know its not an issue of him not being attracted to me because when we're together he's all over me but it just doesn't make me feel so great when I know most other guys his age would probably show more interest in them.

He's also not uncomfortable with receiving them or anything like that. Just wondering why he might be reacting like that or why he doesn't seem to like them?  Probably he just doesn't want to cross any boundaries by screenshotting them [Commentator's opinion]"
"I’ve been seeing someone for a few months, and things have been great so far! 

Over the past few days, something about our text conversations just seems..off? 

I’m not sure if I’m getting too in my head; or if there are subtle signs that this person may be giving via text that he’s no longer interested. 

From a male perspective - what are some things you do to subtly let a girl know that you’ve lost interest, or that your feelings have shifted to more platonic rather than romantic?  For me, if I'm not interested, I'll just tell you that I don't feel a romantic connection and I'll end it. 

But, I suppose if I'm headed that way but haven't made a decision, I'll be texting less often, I won't be making future plans, I won't be as available, my communications will be less personal, no more flirting, etc. [Commentator's opinion]"

"Let’s set the scene. It’s May and I’m talking to this girl, let’s call her Ashley, and she eventually confessed that she likes me. While I would call this a W for me, I’m concerned on if I’m breaking bro code. One of my bros, call him Joey, and her were in a talking stage for a little bit way back in September, but it only lasted a couple weeks after my bro decided to shut it down. She eventually met me and my roommate when we were sitting next to Joey’s friend, she decided to come sit with us along with one of her friends. After a while (I’d say two to three months after this) we started going on walks together, usually with my roommate or her friend accompanying us, but it eventually became us two alone and we started to talk to each other and have deep convos. It wasn’t long after that she confessed and I’ve been stumped. She’s a great woman and I can definitely see myself dating her. However, I can’t shake this one thing. I talked about it with my roommate and he says he sees no foul and I’m gonna bring it up to Joey at some point, but I wanna get the public opinion. Is this a violation of bro code? He shut it down, right?

"needing advice: I (M21) have had a thing with one of my friends (F21) in the area nothing serious just some flirting and playing about. id been working up the balls to ask her out officially but before i could she told me she was moving away for UNI and that she had found a Boyfriend to move in with. because of this we never really talked and we kinda grew apart.

recently she told me that she\`d broken up with the BF and had moved back because she was finished with UNI. we had got back in touch and the flirting has escalated into almost phone sex levels. however again before i could progress our relationship she went quite. now she was always slow to reply but now i\`m being left on read and it seems like she wants nothing to do with me.

i cant stop thinking about her to the point i\`m not interested in other woman but she doesn't seem to feel the same. i cant even talk to her because shes ignoring me.

 Hate to tell you, but you’re not the only one she is talking to.  She’s weighing her options. She reached out to see where you were in your personal life so she can keep you on standby for when her ego needs a pick me up .  She dangled that “phone sex” carrot to keep you interested, and you bit.  Been there, done that.  You are not a priority to her, but another option.  DO NOT prioritize this girl.  You deserve better.

"I was chatting to a girl on tagged (dating app), she wanted to move the chat to telegram, once i chatted to her on telegram she told me that do I want a sugar mummy, she sent me 4 photos of hot ladies and she said pick one and I'll will meet her and have sex with her and then get paid $5000, I'm tempted to check it out, could this be a police stings or scam So this woman randomly offered to make you into a prostitute? 

I'm no expert, but I'm 1000% sure that's not on the level. [Sarcasm]"
"my ex broke up with me 7 months ago saying she wasn't feeling the spark anymore (she didn't cheat). As we were friends from the childhood (not homie type, just good friends), after breakup she tried to stay in contact as friends. i ignored her most of the time because i needed recovery.

She contacted me after 2 days of the breakup asking how i was doing, i just replied good and ignored her. She tried to initiate conversations many times like she went on a movie,what were my plans on a festive day,she had exams that she was worried about etc.I ignore all of those. I have muted her from all of my socials but she always reacts to my posts and stories to this date.

I can say that i have moved on.But the thing is that she was really a good girl. Now i am having this feeling that maybe i should talk to her if she wants to get back with me again. Until now i was mad at the fact that she was the one who showed interest in me 1st, so I don't care about the current so called friendship that only she wants to keep,it is gone anyway. It won't hurt me if she says no, but I dont wanna have this feeling of regret that i never tried to get her back. Now advice me people :"")  If you ask she'll say no. She'll know that leaving you was the right decision. You have respect to lose or gain, drop that girl. [Practical Advice]"
"We’ve been dating for almost 3 years. As everyone is mostly aware, the housing crisis is pretty awful everywhere, so we have decided to start the home buying process. 

I have been saving up for years and making sure my credit is impeccable ever since I was 18. I’ve had a very hard life, and I have finally been able to say I am able to reach my goal of owning a home. My boyfriend is also in on this, and with both of our incomes we can definitely afford a decent home in the current market. 

With this being said, he has no savings and is absolutely terrible with money. He also has no credit history, and relied on me adding him to my accounts in order for us to get approved for a loan. Essentially, this will be my hard work. 

My boyfriend and I are into cars and that’s how we met. He, on a whim, purchased an older sports car for $1,500 about a year ago. I wasn’t totally against it, but I raised a huge concern because of him only able to afford this car because he happened to have made a significantly larger pay check the week before. 

I was excited d about the car because it is fun, and for $1,500 it didn’t ruin us or cause any tension money wise. But when I asked to drive the car, he fully declined and said it was his car and he “worked hard to be able to afford it”. 

Fast forward to last week, after being approved with an amazing interest rate in todays market, I stated how this house is fully mine, and how betrayed I feel that I can sacrifice years of my wants to be able to do this for us. He still has yet to budge and refuses to let me drive the car. 

Would this be a dealbreaker for anyone else?  Never buy a house when you aren't married, never buy a house with a 'grown adult' who is 'terrible with money', his intellectual capacity is WAY too long to do anything major with him ever, it's clear the limit of his forward thinking is literally a single paycheck. You should run from this immediately be done with it tonight [Practical Advice]"
"I (20F) like this guy (20M) but I am several inches taller. I’m 178cm (5’10)  and I would estimate he is 165 cm (5’5). The height difference does not bother me at all but I am worried he might not like it. I do not know how to make it known I like him and the height difference is not a big deal. 

I have talked to guys shorter than me before and it was always a hurdle to get them to understand their height is not an issue. 
 Short fella here, I feel hella good when an Amazon likes me back [Commentator's opinion]"
"I am 37F, he is 48M. We have been dating for a year and he proposed. I said yes because he is a responsible, kind, tolerant and family oriented men. 

About a month before his proposal, I found a letter that he wrote to his EX-EX girlfriend (31F) saying how sorry he was, he misses her EVERYDAY and the biggest mistake he made was not realising how happy they were. Long story short, he was seeking ways to get back together. I confronted him, he said he wrote it at the start of our relationship and he forgot about it. It looks like drunk writing. 

He has over 3000 pictures on his phone and they pops up very often, I don’t even have to look for them, they are just around. That’s why he misses her everyday.  I’m not strong enough to ask him to delete all the pictures because I know I have no right to do it since I already ask him to unfollow her on Instagram (don’t want to be reminded all the time big data pushes her to me). This little chapter happened and has become an underlying issue in my head that she is his true love. if the girl sees a chance to be with him again in the future, what decision is he gonna make?  He is with me just because I’m here and I seemed like a right choice for wife? 

If I’m 10 years younger, I would just walk away, easy. What should I do, it’s a life decision to make. 
  So he basically was saying his BIGGEST mistake in life was not staying with his ex?  Oh lord…I’m gonna hold ur hand when i tell you this, no man that has moved on keeps THREE THOUSAND pics of an ex. This should’ve been figured out before planning and perusing marriage!!! You shouldn’t even have to tell someone you’re dating/getting married to to unfollow an ex. Especially one they’re clearly hung up on. He did you a disservice by not healing before perusing you. At this point i wouldn’t put it past him to have gotten with you, hoping he’d get over his ex. Is he with you because you’re “good enough” and he doesn’t have his ex? Is he pushing for marriage because he’s almost 50? He can love you and be a good man while still having a desire for his ex unfortunately. Do not go through with a wedding without being 100% sure it’s what you want and your soon to be husband isn’t wishing he had his ex in the picture. (Which will inevitably create problems in the future) If he could propose before moving on i don’t see him all of a sudden or quickly moving on now. You have some things to rethink and should start by talking to him. [Practical Advice]"
"My girlfriend quit vaping two months ago. Since then, I've frequently reminded her of how proud I am of her and I assure her I am here to support her in any way. Recently, she has been undergoing a lot of stress from a summer job leading to burnout. Today, she has been expressing to me how much she wants to buy a new vape, but she doesn't want for me to be disappointed. My disappointment is the only thing holding her back. I have always told her that I would be honest and that I would be disappointed. I reassure her that I am not telling her she cannot vape and that it is ultimately her decision to make. I remind her that I will support her and love her regardless. How am I supposed to navigate this? 

I don't know what to say because the conversation always returns to her saying she doesn't want me to be disappointed. I try telling her that it is your body, your health, and your decision to make. If that is how you choose to cope, I understand. If anyone has recommendations for this conversation, I would appreciate it. I refuse to enable this habit and encourage her to use nicotine to cope, but I refuse to stop her from doing what she wants. I am fully supportive of her making these decisions for herself and I encourage her to not worry about what I think. She needs to do what she thinks is best. I just don't know how to support her anymore or what to say. Thank you for any input. kind of sounds like to me she's actually looking to you for support in not buying a vape. Doing something like this by yourself is very difficult, and it's usually very helpful to have somebody you're held accountable to. It almost sounds like she wants you to talk her out of getting a vape? Have you asked her if this is how she wants you to support her? [Commentator's opinion]"
"Just got into dating apps..I have no idea what I'm doing on there lol. 

I liked this guy and he liked me back which means he matched me, but no text. Am I supposed to text first? Does it matter? The app is hinge btw 

And why the heck are people blurred on apps like bumble and tinder? If they like me and I can't see anything about their profile then I'm not going to like back..but is that how it's supposed to work? >Does it matter?

"So my boyfriend (24M) and I (24F) have been together for 2 months and we live 2 1/2 hours away. We both live with our parents and don’t have our own place. 

It sucks when the distance isn’t that far but far enough where we can’t be intimate with one another. The only thing we can do is book a hotel room but that becomes costly. Any advice on where else we can be intimate at that won’t be costly? 

(I feel like an obvious answer is our car but we never hang out late enough to have privacy sooooo) Weekend camping trips at the state/national park nearest the halfway point?

Hiking on secluded trails. Secluded beaches. Places without cameras/lots of foot traffic. 

At some point, you're either going to have to get a place together, or introduce each other to your parents and broach the subject of sleepovers. Are your parents ever not home? [Practical Advice]"
"I (23f) have been seeing this guy (26m) for about a month and a half. We hang out 3-4 times a week, talk a bit, have hooked up, and he acts like we are in a relationship. well, i decided to ask the “so what are we” question and he said:

“If you want to know how I feel, i definitely like you and enjoy your company always. As far as what I’m looking for, I told you before that in the past I’ve always jumped from relationship to relationship and I’m really hoping I don’t do that this time. I’m not ready to give someone my 100% undivided attention just yet, just because I’ve never given myself that kind of attention. I’m truly looking to become the best version of myself before i commit to someone honestly. I’ll tell you right now i don’t talk to any other girls nor am i looking to talk to anyone else. If this were any other time in my life I would’ve already asked you to be my girlfriend but I’m not the type to do something unless I know I can put 100% effort in and there’s just so much I’m still figuring out about myself.”

How do i even respond to this? I’m fine with waiting, but i don’t want to be putting in all this effort and time be strung along for no reason. idk how to convey this in a way that doesn’t seem bitchy, i feel like just outwardly saying that won’t sound right, ya know? he’s a great guy and i enjoy the time we spend together, but i don’t want to hurt myself in the long run, so i know it’s better to get clarity now. 

Idk how to even respond to this ugh. help. what would you do? :( there's no timetable for him to be ready to be in another relationship. i wouldnt wait around. he basically wants a fwb situation.

you can say something like this(assuming you are looking for serious relationship):

""thanks for being honest with me and where you stand. at this time i am looking for someone who can give me their 100% and wants to date and progress into a relationship. i think its best we take a break from seeing each other so you can focus on yourself and i can focus on finding someone that is aligned with what i am looking."" [Practical Advice]"
"I’m going to try my best to explain my situation here, so sorry if this is very long. I (20m) have been talking to this girl (19f) for a few weeks that I met at work. We seemed to get along very well and eventually we went out to a coffee place one day and we stayed for a few hours and I felt it went well. However, that day she did tell me that she is bi, which isn’t a problem, I just didn’t expect it, and I have never talked to anyone who is bi before. I am saying this because I feel like it has an effect on the current situation. A few days later we went to an MLB game together and she told me afterwards via text that she had a lot of fun, and I said I did as well. We never actually put a label on the times we went out, I have no idea what she thinks of me or if she saw those as dates or just 2 friends hanging out. I was afraid to break the touch barrier because I don’t know what she would do, I thought about it, but I didn’t, she wasn’t dropping any obvious hints.  We were talking about going to Six Flags together in the coming weeks, and I messaged her a day later to talk about that because I did research about it. She usually takes kind of a while to respond so we were trying to figure it out over the next few days and then she just stopped responding to my texts the other day. However, she still snaps me (half/full face pics) and has been doing it for a few days now. I haven’t seen her in person since the game, but I think we both work together this week a few times so I’ll see her then. Is she avoiding talking to me because she’s unsure about what to do?  Is she slowly pulling away because she thought I would make a move? I don’t feel like I did anything wrong, I need advice on what to do. I would prefer a relationship, but I am totally ok with just being friends if she doesn’t want that because I think she’s a cool person. When I see her this week I’m planning to just talk to her normally. I just wish I knew how she felt about this whole thing. Any advice would be appreciated. Shoutout to everyone who read the whole thing.  Just off the title, it’s all bad [Commentator's opinion]"
"She broke up with me a day ago, and I know it’s normal to be feeling physical and mental symptoms from the breakup. I think the only thing keeping me from imploding is the hope I have that she might come back. She said that the reason we broke up was because after I was gone for two weeks, she had the realization that she missed me more like a friend than a boyfriend, and that she had been feeling like that for a few weeks now that she looked back. She was having panic attacks the day and night before we broke up, and she said it was partially because she was thinking about breaking up. She said that she didn’t feel the deep comfort level that she feels people like her close friends and that it is something that somebody either feels or they don’t. She said that I deserved better. I thought we were going strong and we had even planned to see each other twice this coming week 2 days prior to the breakup. It caught me very off guard, as I was starting to let my guard down from being hurt when I finally started thinking about the future with people. We dated for about 2 months and a little over a week. We are both entering our senior year of high school. I also feel like we were just getting out of the honeymoon phase, but I don’t think she is experienced enough in relationships to understand that as I was her first. We were both crying on the call when we broke up. I thought we actually could’ve been something. Is there any chance she will change her mind? If there is a chance, how long should I hope for her to text me again before I send out my own hail mary(I will no matter what for my own peace)? Or should I even see if we could meet up in person for some in person closure/reconciliation attempt(we live ~45min apart)?

Extra: When she broke up with me I didn’t try to save the relationship or reason with her. I was just in shock and accepted it while spilling my left over feelings. Leave her alone. She has told you she no longer wants to be with you and she's told you that it was really hard for her to have the break up conversation with you. 

You need to respect her decision and don't contact her. [Commentator's opinion]"
"So we met about 1-2 times but we got eachother contact, we text alot in the first month, things going great, she seems to like it and we talk alot but in the second month it get repetitive so I tried to ask her out, go have a dinner or something, I thought she gonna agree but she's not. I didn't even say this was a date, just have a dinner as a friend.

After that I ask her out a couple more times throughout the week but she still don't want to go, I start to think ""Am I really that bad that even a friend don't want to meet me?"". It's not like she is busy all the time, I saw she's still hangout with her friends alot but just not me.

So now should I keep continue to text her daily  and wait for another chance or just done with this weird relationship and move on? stop wasting your time and move on. she likes the attention, thats it [Practical Advice]"
"I need to go over this man and continue with my life. What’s the best way to forget about him and stop the urge to text him?  Focusing on something else and give it time 

Instead of texting, write down what you would say on a piece of paper

Afterwards, rip it up

I don’t recommend attempting to cope with substances or another person. All that does is stall your healing. You’ll be miserable for much longer [Practical Advice]"
"Me 19F and my friend 19NB, have been friends since middle school. Its been twice since they made a move on me and I rejected them. But they still make me uncomfortable like them being like, “It’s so weird because I love people that I’ve known for so long. Even if I can’t be with them... Like I’m in love with their soul.. blah blah...” 
It sucks really bad because I feel like they only like me because I’m a girl. Like if I was a guy, this wouldn’t be a problem. But I don’t know if I’m overthinking it. Should I distance myself? I don’t want to lose them as a best friend.

TLDR: Best friend possibly in love with me. Should I confront ? Should I just ignore ? Or distance myself. You need to tell them it makes you a bit uncomfortable and accept that may dent the friendship. You've made it clear there's no romantic interest but they're continuing to gesture towards it.

"I have (29m) a 2yr old toddler with my girlfriend (23f). My girlfriend has a twin sister who lives a delusional life with no accountability whatsoever. She is also in an abusive relationship with her fiancé (31m) who she is going to marry soon. They also have a 2 yr old toddler as well. 

The fiancé is not only abusive towards my gf sister but he has cursed out there mom and threatened there little brother (12m) in the past year or so. He threatened my girlfriend because she refused to watch their 2 yr old after he had got into an argument with her sister. He told her in a text message that “I will slap the shit out of you and your bf bitch, fuck you and everybody around you”. And proceed to block her number. We did not see him for a very long time until recently the sister invited us to their 2 year olds party.

At his daughter’s party I did not speak to him the entire time. He spoke to everyone but me. Party ended and we didn’t see her sister and him again until Memorial Day. Even after the disrespect the mom decided to invite him over because she is a “forgiving Christian woman” as my gf would say. The entire time at the house, this guy did not speak to me neither once did he even look my way. We all sat at the dinner table and ate and he was very quiet..almost like he didn’t want to be there. I can tell he felt really uncomfortable. Eventually it ended and we didn’t see the fiancé and her sister again until their older sister’s birthday party. And again he spoke to everybody but me. He doesn’t even talk to my gf really, he just say “hi” and that’s it.

Couple day’s ago, my gf sister randomly invites herself and her fiancé over with there toddler. Our kids are pretty close to each other. My gf said “No” she would not like them to come over because she does not like her fiancé, she said her sisters entire attitude switched from happy to offended. I don’t speak to this guy at all and he does not speak to me either. And the sister knows this but still seems to be forcing a relationship , that will never exist. Her sister is oblivious to his actions. She always uses phrases like “the past is the past” and she and him are good at playing victim too.

I can’t control who is at their mom’s house but, I can control who I am around and who comes into my home. I find it very disturbing how the sister overlooks his behavior and does not address him at all about his behavior. Are the sister and the fiancé worth addressing? Any advice? Screw them. I would just explain to the sister that saying things like ""the past is the past"" is how abuse continues and you don't need to feel uncomfortable in your own home. I'd say you love an support the sister but can't have that man around imagine what he could possibly do to your child! [Commentator's opinion]"
"We have been dating for six years. I love him very much and he is my best friend. We only see each other on the weekends when we are home from university. We either meet at his parents or my parents house and sleep together there. He is very good looking and really sweet. I often get the urge to hug/kiss/touch him but not much more than that. I do sometimes feel sexually attracted to him but it is rare. He is very attracted to me. I am capable of being sexually attracted to men. And do feel sexually attracted to other men, but i immediately let those thoughts go and would never be unfaithful, i just mean i do feel natural sexual attraction sometimes. I think i might have a weird relationship with sex. I feel like it is shameful and feel like love is and should be innocent and cute. Therefore maybe i feel like love and lust don’t go together in my head.  
Does anyone have any tips for this problem, or any explanations/theories? 
 Staying with the same guy you’ve been with since 13 might sound sweet but if you arent sexually attracted to him - indicative that it isn’t a good fit. There are others out there - maybe you’re limiting yourself by holding on to something that has naturally run its course. [Commentator's opinion]"
"is the saying “once a cheater always a cheater” true or it really depends on the situation?

"I’ve had good partners in the past (fair household split and mental load is discussed) so it’s not like I am doing all the work. It’s just that I can’t focus on myself, when I am living with someone else in terms of organization and it feels like my whole world surrounds them. 

I’ve been with my partner for 4 years now, living together for 3 1/2 years and we’ve worked a lot on ourselves to get to a really healthy and good relationship. 

What bothers me is that I feel like it takes so much mental work to focus on myself everyday. I feel like I am super dependent on what he does/when he’s around and the only time I ever feel in control is when he’s out of town and I have our place to myself. That’s always the time when I feel like I am getting a total glow-up (working out, having a routine, cooking & eating healthy)

I’ve grown up with a mother who gave her whole life up to „built“ her husband and be the woman behind. She is to this day pretty unhappy about her life choices and I try to always remember to not live and burn for somebody else. 

I also was recently diagnosed with adhd and high functioning autism, he has adhd (not sure if this matters). 

Another important thing to add is that I’ve felt like this with every person I’ve dated/been in a relationship so I think this is a me-problem.

Does anybody have advice/thoughts on this or similar experiences? I want to live for myself, I am in therapy and will address this topic, but right now I just feel lost and could use some perspective. You may benefit from making yourself a weekly schedule that purposefully includes 'alone' time to pursue with your own friends or hobbies. Feel free to put this schedule up in a shared space, too. You might also consult with him on when you want to schedule date nights/time together (such as dinner + an hour before or after) so that you two have specific time you know will be spent together, and then you are free to schedule whatever outside of that.

"I am dating a guy that I have known for 3 months. He is extremelly close with a female friend from another country that he met online while gaming 3 years ago. He travelled to her country to visit her 2 years ago and yesterday he told me they also travelled together to another country . She travelled to his country (where we live) too. It all happened around 1.5 years ago. It's also important to add that he has recently told me that she recently came out as a lesbian and in the past he has also told me that he has only ever had sex with 1 person, his ex GF of 10 years

He gave me the impression that him and this female friend talk every day and are very close to each other. Now I fear that they may have had something, or that him at least had feelings for her. I don't know if I should ask him about this or not... I don't want to be the replacement because he could not have a relationship with her due to the distance or something else. I don't want to be that.

What should I do? 
 You have spend quite a time with him now so you should just go and ask him and if lies you would be able to identify that just checkout his behaviour while give him the question and when he replies it. This would be a fast process but it's a trick and works most of the time [Practical Advice]"
"Whats up, I just met a girl on fb dating and we have been talking for about 5 days now. In the beginning (which I know is fast, I thought we clicked right away) we were flirting and getting to know each other. She said she liked me, her best friend approved of me, I thought it was kicking off to a great start. She came over to my house on the 2nd day, and we hung out and talked. She had a great time, things got a little spicy, but we didn't sleep together. After she left, I told her I had a great time, she said she did too . I mentioned something about hanging out again and she said she would like that, so the next day, I asked her if there was a day where her kid could be watched and we could go get dinner. She said don't know, and texted me later saying that she doesn't think we were gonna work out, and that we had nothing in common. I asked her if she wanted to talk and see where it goes and she said sure. I wasn't trying to rush anything, im just very confused. I've never been interested with someone who has these symptoms, and we are still talking through out the day just not like we were before. Did I screw up somewhere? Am I wasting my time? I'm so confused, she said I was awesome and I had her laughing her ass off the whole time. Any advice is appreciated Take it and run bro, you don’t want any part of that long term, trust me.  Even if she’s on meds now doesn’t mean they won’t stop working down the road and she’ll ruin your life.  Get out while you can. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I’m a 36M and gf is 32F. Been together almost 8 years. Throughout the years I’ve dealt with episodes of her throwing rage fits. The first time I dealt with it was in year two of dating. We got into an argument at a friend’s wedding, but it was so long ago I don’t even remember what it was about. We stayed overnight in our private bedroom and she punched me in the chest 3 times because she was so mad at something I said. I was shook. Like holy shit, did I just experience domestic abuse for the first time in my life? She apologized, we made up and moved on. There have been 3 other incidents where her rage has taken over since then. Slamming doors, punching through a window and shattering the glass is one of them. Multiple doors slammed and screaming at the top of her lungs. Each time I’ve walked out of the house and didn’t come back for 2-3 days. She hasn’t laid her hands on me since that first incident. This is all over the span of almost 8 years. 

Her Mom passed in year 4. I was a pallbearer. We’ve gone through a lot in our relationship. I’ve hoped for change, but this past week she blew up again. This time it was about her own personal work life. She exploded and went on a rageful rampage and shattered our bedroom window by punching it. Luckily she didn’t cut herself. 

She’s gone to therapy to cope with the passing of her mom. She’s tried to self medicate with pot. She has no close friends where we live. Nothing has helped. I’ve found myself being her therapist, psychiatrist, psychologist, best friend, etc…I’m EXHAUSTED. We’ve been discussing potentially breaking up. It’s so hard right now. I’m confused. Investing so much time and so many years in a relationship, and now considering breaking up is baffling. We’re at a crossroads. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Any advice would be much appreciated. It's incredibly tough to be in a relationship where rage issues are present. Your safety and well-being should always come first. It's important to consider seeking support from a professional counselor or therapist for guidance on how to navigate this situation, especially if you're feeling exhausted and unsure about the future of your relationship. Taking care of yourself emotionally and mentally is crucial. [Emotional Support]"

"Me (23M) and my partner (23F) have been together for 7 months now. Lately, she's been acting a bit distant and cold. Then yesterday, she opened up to me about something bothering her. It seems like she's unsure about getting married in the future or becoming dependent on her spouse. She mentioned she might prefer being independent down the road and isn't sure if she wants us to get married eventually or if she wants to marry me. She assured me she's not leaving, but it's left me feeling uncertain about where our relationship is heading. Maybe she just needs some time to figure things out. Now I'm anxious, wondering if our relationship might end or if she's thinking about marrying someone else.



I'm starting to worry that maybe she's interested in someone else, especially since most of her close friends and coworkers are guys from her workplace. I'm not sure what to do or how to process all of this.



She also mentioned she wants to be alone in the future so she can hang out and bond more with her friends. But right now, she already spends time with them and her coworkers. I'm not sure if that's really the reason or if there's more to it. I'm just feeling confused by everything she's said. OK, but so what?  How is this impacting your building your future?  Your constant self improvement?  This woman just told you she doesn't really see a future with you right now, but she will keep you around because you provide boyfriend energy and maybe she will change her mind.  So who cares about her?

Focus on building your future.  This woman is not the one for you, she is just keeping you from finding that woman.  

And, yeah, everyone is going to tell you (rightfully) she is probably hooking up with some of these guys.  She is living her best life, has you doing boyfriend stuff while winning cool boyfriend awards while she plays party girl when she wants.  Works great for her.

But the real question, again, is how is your self improvement coming?  How is your gym and fitness coming?  What is the next hobby skill you are looking to develop coming?  How is your career and income plan going?  Looking for a better job?  How is all of that?  I want to hear about your near term goals, your long term goals, this woman is just distracting you from that.

Because fuck this woman.  You should still be head down focused on your grind bettering yourself with no time for drama and women that bring it to your life.  You got a couple of years before you get serious about looking for a wife, and she aint it.  She is just a time waister.  And likely you don't want to know what else she is.

So get back on your grind and forget this woman.  Every day, self improve.  There is nothing with this woman to even fight for. [Emotional Support]"
"My boyfriend [21M] of 2.5 years rung me [22F] on the phone yesterday and admitted that he got a handjob from a masseuse in Bali on their boys trip. They have been there for the past week and this happened the first night they got there, I only found it yesterday (5 days later after it happened). He went with 3 of his friends, 2 of which are in relationships with girls who are close friends of mine, one who is my housemate. 2 of them got blowjobs but my boyfriend only got a handjob, or so he says. They had been drinking all day at a beach club and apparently walked past it on the way home. The two other girlfriends know what happened aswell. 

I’m feeling conflicted and although he’s extremely remorseful, the idea of it all just makes me uncomfortable and sick. Keep in mind they also paid quite a bit of money to get this done. I don’t know if this is bad enough for me to break it off because I do truly love him and he has never given me another reason to not trust him. Dude, if he's willing to risk his relationship over a handy, it ain't worth keeping him around. You're too young to deal with this trash. Rat him and his bros out and walk. I don't know what other reason you need to not trust him. It isn't like cheaters always give a litany of reasons. They just cheat. Lol. [Practical Advice]"
"So i struggle a little with following up on girls making a move on me... either because i believe they are just being friendly or because i do not want to seem creepy.

I'm a 6"" tall Caucasian bachelor from germany in my early 30s with good career and fitness and i would say, overall attractive. On occasions i am being approached by women who ask for things or just strike a conversation with me. I am now finally smart enough to understand that this is indeed a sort of ""invitation"" - (took me way too long to figure that out, i know...)

Anyway, i am a timid person although not shy at all... but i can be socially a little awkward. Even when they obviously flirt with me or make excuses to touch me, i am not quite sure how to respond. Apparently, i have never had a healthy role-model if it comes to ""boundaries"" and what sort of ""risk"" is appropriate to cross them.

Its totally different once we get to know each other however and have some thing going already... usually its absolute smooth sailing from there.... i do not get there a lot though because i believe i am being too ""respectful"" maybe. Does that make sens?

As a ""successful"" man reading this - i would just love some general advice on how you do it.

I am open about my feelings more often than not, in a healthy, communicative way. Other than that i would identify as stoic. Not sure if this actually a thing that turns women off or on... probably depending on the girl tho. I am mostly dating women in their mid 20s and keep respectful distance to divorced women or single-mothers. I would like children of my own but am fine with casual relationships. if the invitation is there, you just need to flirt back, and exchange the info be it numbers or social media. then plan to take them on dates. dont make it too complicated [Practical Advice]"
"I'll try my best to explain, so I had a interest of sorts in my partner for a good 2 months before I got asked out, the problem is looking back on it now I don't know if it was romantic or not. I have always been a bit of an emotionless person for as long as I have known and the few emotions I have felt I never really understood what they were. But despite that I said yes when I was asked out. And at first I didn't sense anything off about how I felt until my partner talked about joining me in my plans for the future i.e moving to a different country and such. I felt really apprehensive/strange about it, though it didn't seem out of character since my partner is a very affectionate and overall genuine soul. So a bit later my partner and I had a film date and he was hugging me and kissed me on the cheek. This made me very awkward because I don't like physical affection, I used to be really bad and especially around hugs, I had a friend hug me once and I physically felt repulsed/shivered and then afterwards I felt like throwing up. Then my partner and I were messaging and they mentioned missing me and wanting to see me soon again, I couldn't because I was jam packed and had no time. A good while later they mentioned it again and made a dramatization of just how much they wanted to see me. And I realized at that point that I didn't feel a need to be around them like that and that I was ok with not seeing him for extended periods of time because messages were good enough. With this realization, I came to have another one and that was that I don't think I feel anything when I look at them while they look at me as if I'm their world (as some of my observer friends said). I wanted some advice so I don't prolong a relationship that just has someone putting all their love and effort into it only for it to not be reciprocated no matter how hard I try. The thing is I don't want to disappoint him or the people who care about him. Just break up, you're clearly not interested in the same kind of relationship. [Practical Advice]"
"I met my 31m coworker and started talking to him about 2-3 months ago…. We got very close or at least I thought we did he came over a couple of times to my apartment and took me out to eat twice. We never had sex but we did almost everything else. Had phone calls texted almost everyday and I got so attached. Recently he’s been blocking me from seeing his stories and he blocked me on instagram when we didn’t even have each other on there in the first place. We are still each others #1 friends on Snapchat if that means anything at all. But he hasn’t spoken to me in the last two days. I miss him and have to see him everyday at work for probably the next 2 years. Please if you have any advice I’d truly appreciate it and please don’t be rude as I’m already hurt.  I mean, you've been relegated to a booty call. This isn't how you treat someone you want a relationship with.

Want better than this for yourself OP: time to let it settle in that this is a dead end, and if they're looking to hang out with you, you probably end up feeling used the next day. [Commentator's opinion]"
"He and I have been together for almost 8 years now, and this has been an ongoing problem the whole time. The main problem to me is I can’t bring up concerns without him arguing with how I feel, getting defensive, making excuses, blaming me, or turning the tables on me. 

For example, he and I were gaming together and something he was doing was kind of bothering me a little so I decided to ask him his preferred way to go about that thing so I could adjust. In a game we like to play together, looting is a great way to get coin and supplies. Bits and bobs. He often cuts me off in the game to loot where I was trying to go. Kind of annoying but no big deal. So I asked him if he’d prefer to do all the looting and I can do other stuff in the meantime.  He took exception to that, huffed, and asked me what my problem was. I didn’t want to fight so I said that. It really wasn’t a big deal and I didn’t want it to turn into one. He responded by telling me he’s sick of me painting him out to be the bad guy and like his existence is annoying and a burden. 

This sort of things happens every single time I bring up a concern with him. No matter how benign. No matter how delicately I put it.  If it’s not super fun for him to hear, he takes it personally. Like I attacked him and now we’re enemies. Every. Single. Time. Without fail. 


I’ve told him (ad nauseam) that I should be able to bring up concerns and it not turn into a fight. He agrees and promises to do better next time. He doesn’t. Ever. And I’m not exaggerating. It hasn’t gotten even a little better over this 8 years. He’s spiteful and disingenuous and disrespectful during these unfun conversations when all I’m trying to do is just tell him how I feel. 


I know at this point I’m a fool in love. I know he’s shown me time and time again who he is and how he handles things. And yet, I stay. Hoping it will get better, knowing it won’t. What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I leave him? How do I show myself I deserve better? Why cant I effing leave?? This isn’t love you’re feeling. It’s habitual. This is all your body knows around this person. 

Maybe the truth is you keep choosing this man because somewhere along your life you were told that this was the best you were going to get. Being dismissed and minimised, not being heard or seen. Not cared for fully. You’re accepting this from him. Do you think you may have self esteem issues? That’s a long period of time to be ground down on [Commentator's opinion]"
"My(31 F) partner(47 M) and I have been dating for a little bit over a year now. We got engaged (unofficially) 2 months ago. Some of my family and almost all of my friends now about it, he said he will tell his family closer to and when we have an actual wedding date. My OH, has a 7 yo son from past relationship which he spends time every school break-I have been seeing and spending time with his son as well those times his son is with us as we also have been living together like 10 months now. So my partner told me he was going to tell his son about us getting married, and I was nervous but then excited that he was going to tell this important event to one and if not, to the most important person in his life. Fast forward, he hasn’t already told his son yet. So I opened this up last night about me feeling insecure about us my partner said his son and I gets along well, he thinks there wouldn’t be an issue and he said 100% this has nothing to do with us but all to do with the timing to tell his son. Well a week ago, he casually asked his son hey son do you want us to be together in a long time? And his 7 year old said yes. So as much as I want to be understanding, I really don’t see why he couldn’t just tell his son hey, well were getting married. The last thing my partner said to me last night is that he wants to be 100 sure as he cant take it back. Uhmm I think to me that’s more to do with him being unsure about us and has nothing to do with his son? Thoughts? When you say “unofficially” engaged, what do you mean? [Not Relevant]"
"For some background, I (20F) have never had a boyfriend since I've always been happy on my own. When it comes to dating, I don't have a strong interest in in pursuing one and kinda have a ""if it happens, it happens"" mentality around it. For the past 7-ish weeks, I started talking and hanging out with a guy from my apartment complex after meeting him at a party since we had a few artsy hobbies in common. 

I let him know in the beginning that I've never had a boyfriend and wasn't comfortable with anything fast-paced, so we have been keeping things mostly casual (just some cuddling), and unfortunately, I'm just not feeling it. Seeing as that I've never really had romantic feelings, I quite literally have no idea what they feel like, so I have been pushing to see if I maybe I feel something. 

After a lifetime of feeling this way, I'm slowly realizing that it's time for some self-reflection to explore the possibility that I'm aromantic or ace. However, I feel horrible about the whole thing. He suffers from anxiety and depression and has also confessed to me that he has Aspergers and that he struggles a lot with being lonely. I tried to hold out to see if I just develop feelings slower, and to see if some of the social awkwardness attributed with his Aspergers would lessen as he became more comfortable with me, but neither has been the case. I'm finding more and more that regardless of whatever my confusing feelings are, we just aren't that compatible and that there are very uneven levels of attraction. He constantly wants to hang out and when we do, I do 80% of the communication and just there isn't much flow to it. 

I've had to let men down before, but I'm struggling for this scenario because 1) How long we've been talking, 2) The fact that I actually may not experience romantic/sexual attraction to men, and 3) How much he's both directly and indirectly vocalized his desire for a girlfriend. I just need to tell him in person the next time we meet, what do you think is the best way to not hurt him? As a dude, please be direct. Just say that you’re not feeling it and you wish him the best.

"So I met with this guy overseas as part of a tour that he was a guide for, we clicked and it was an instant connection.

Fast forward, he contacted me on Whatsapp and we spoke for two weeks and everything was fine. Checking on me multiple times a day, quick replies, we briefly saw each other outside my hotel a few times coz I was there with my fam.

We decided to meet a day before my flight back home and things happened between us, it was just perfect. He was good and acted like a gentleman, wanted me to stay in his country for long term or plans about him coming to visit me etc.

However, since I landed back home, his behaviour has changed very cold towards me. He took hours to reply or sometimes a whole day and that too, only two messages in 24 hours. Have I been played? How do I confront him? If that’s all what he wanted, why does he still messages me? He is probably busy hitting on girls in the next tour that he's guiding! Move on! [Practical Advice]"
"I (19f) met this guy (21m) at a bar last summer and we’ve been talking for almost a year now. I started at college last year so it was obvious our relationship wasn’t going anywhere at the time but we did talk some throughout the school year. On top of that- he is in the military and is only stationed in my area he literally lives across the country. This summer since I’ve been back we have been hanging out like 3 days a week and sleeping over with each-other like 3 days a week. We go on “dates” being movies baseball games really casual dinners stuff like that- almost friend activities. Physically it hasn’t gone very far- we make out, cuddle, I give him head and he has fingered me but that’s it. He hasn’t brought up a future between us and I can tell he views our relationship as really casual. 

My dilemma is we are both anticipating sex but I have never had sex with someone I have an emotional connection to; only with random club guys I see once. I fear that if we do, I will become attached and would have to deal with that emotional baggage when I leave again for college. Is it wise just to avoid sex for the next two months and just keep it as casual as possible? I want to be more intimate but I have a feeling it’s going to make things more painful for me in the end- especially at this point in our “relationship” . Help. I don't think no-strings attached sex works for men and even less for women. It's not sustainable (at least wasn't for me). Trust your gut feeling on this. I went against mine and got punished eventually. [Commentator's opinion]"
"Recently started seeing this girl I met on a dating app (we’re both 21). When we first started talking I was confident she liked me, we would have text conversations until 2am and had good chemistry on the first date. However, lately I’m feeling like I’m getting mixed signals. I’m very shy so I haven’t really made any overt physical contact moves but I’ve been trying to kinda lightly touch her and see how she reacts. On our second date she wasn’t pulling away at all, but now on our third date today it seemed like she was pulling away abt half the time I tried to get close to her. Not certain tho, I’m really bad at reading body language which is why I havent rlly made any moves (not even holding her hand). She also takes a long time to respond to texts when she never used to, even when ik she’s on her phone bc she posts on her story. But she also still texts back (eventually), isn’t dry, texts first, and keeps agreeing to dates (and yes, I am being careful to explicitly call them dates). And on dates conversations seem to flow well and have a somewhat flirty vibe (mutual teasing). 

So basically I was wondering if I should just straight up text her “hey do you like me” bc honestly it’s kinda just driving me insane to think about. Or would that be weird and potentially risk giving her the ick lmao. 
 How would a woman act if she didn’t like you? Would she go on dates with you? [Sarcasm]"
"I [30 M] met this girl [25 F] at work.  From the beginning we had a really great relationship (not romantically), a lot of common jokes and topics for conversation. But we didn't go out with each other outside of work (apart from one time to a place we both liked). I recently found out that she is taking a long leave of absence, after which she does not return to work. I thought this might be my last chance, so I invited her to the place where we first went out after work.  She agreed.  We had a really great time, she told me about herself and her future plans (we hadn't even shared such information before). The next day she texted me to ask how much money she had to pay me back for yesterday. I said he didn't have to give anything back. Then we exchanged a few messages and now she's silent. The problem is that from the moment she first wrote, the average time for her to respond is 24 hours. She supposedly told me that she had a lot on her mind in the near future: a friend's wedding or a vacation with her parents, but in my head I had a sentence that was usually true: if someone likes you, that person will always find time for you.

I'm confused now. Is this some kind of hot and cold treatment or she's simply not interested? Maybe I'm just overthinking?

Any intelligent advice and feedback is welcomed and appreciated. Thanks!  Go on another date, and this time, escalate to flirting and kissing if you are comfortable. If she doesn't respond well to that, then you have your answer. [Practical Advice]"
"
At 26, I don’t see how this will happen otherwise.  I could feign attraction to a desperate woman who doesn’t take care of herself but that seems even worse.  Or I could date significantly younger women (20-21) but that also seems kind of exploitative.

I’ve made multitudes of attempts to get to know women and then ask them out, only to get rejected for inexperience.  So I’m planning on paying for it, just ONCE to get it out of the way.

If it’s a huge turn-off, then I know I have to hide it as well. If you have no issue hiding that you’ve slept with a prostitute, why do you have an issue hiding your virginity? Don’t do the prostitute because it’s a lot more controversial to do that than to just be a virgin. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I’m just shocked rn… i’m 24… this guy told me he was 27. He just admitted that he’s 33. what? I’m not a fucking 18 year old, i’m 24. and he still lied about his age. 

It’s not an age gap at all, but i’m just shocked. He’s a bit weird too. I think i’m going to “end things”. 

He said that he lied about his age because “old people” like him get rejected a lot due to their age. What? 

if he lied about his age, he can lie about anything else

I’m pretty upset right now, not going to lie. 

whatever though. I feel like ghosting him. he even said, “don’t hate me, please” 

such bullshit… 

EDIT: but should i just ghost him, block him and move on,  or just say goodbye to him? 

2nd edit: Damn, this blew up. i ghosted him, but I might send him a goodbye message tomorrow or the next day. 

I’m just upset, because I really like the way he was/is. Except for the fact that he’d want to talk about sex mostly all the time and would ask for nudes often. 🤦‍♀️ “i can’t wait to fuck you” “i’m going to destroy your pussy” “i want to have you with me already” “once i have enough money, i’ll fly out to see you” “Even if we don’t connect i’ll still gladly live with you so we can be friends with benefits” 

he even had the audacity to say “since everything is going well between us, i must admit that I don’t want any lies between us. so the truth is, i lied to you about my age. i’m 33” 🤦‍♀️  He’s probably not 33 either. [Commentator's opinion]"
"My GF (18F) and I (18M) have been together officially for a year and about 2 years unofficially. First, I have to admit my GF did say that she doesn't enjoy physical touch that much. For example we haven't kissed yet because she finds kissing 'disgusting and weird,' I've accepted it and I'm okay with that. 

We do have moments of physical touch but I initiate it only, like holding hands and fondling. Even so when we're hanging out at my house she doesn't sit close me (I have to move over towards her) We've talked about it and she says that she doesn't necessarily 'love' the physical touch but she's **okay** with it. 

Also, we're not very good at communicating. I find it very hard to talk to her about being more physically intimate (and just more personal things about myself in general) For example when we talk about more personal things she changes the subject quickly. 

What should I do? Should I try to talk to her? Just tough it out? Or start thinking about the end of the relationship? Personally, I feel guilty about wanting more physical affection and that I shouldn't want it since she isn't keen on it.

tldr: My GF isn't a very physically affectionate person and I'm not sure how to get more physical affection. (or if i should) You want physical touch and affection, she doesn't. It sounds like you are incompatible and should probably think about ending the relationship. It sucks, but it doesn't sound like a fixable issue and it will almost definitely breed resentment between the two of you if it hasn't already. Try and be more open about your needs if you haven't properly expressed them already but don't expect her to suddenly change her preferences just because you're being more open. At the end of the day, you both deserve someone who wants the same level of affection. 'Toughing it out' is not a characteristic of a good, happy relationship. [Practical Advice]"
"Hello! I (26M) have a question, after ending a long relationship I’ve been trying for a year to find someone to go out with but I think my personality is not attractive, and it even bothers some people.

At parties I tend to be more of a clown, people usually laugh at me as much as with me, I am somewhat hyperactive, I involve screams, etc., in everyday life I am not usually like that because I keep myself more busy and focused, but in my free time with friends yes, and I don’t know if the right thing is to suppress that type of attitude or I should continue looking as I am...

PS: if this is not the indicated subreddit, I would appreciate it if you redirected me Every person is different, and they’re going to prefer something different in a man’s personality.

You shouldn’t have to suppress who you are to find someone who loves you. They should enjoy you as you are. Wait for someone who does.

BUT, also ask people you know and trust if anything you do is considered off-putting. You can always work on social behaviors that people consider inappropriate. If they tell you that you’re good, then don’t worry about it. If they tell you something that you should change, then change it! [Practical Advice]"

"  
I 29F am pregnant and have been only dating my fiance 34M for a year. We are getting married and things are going good . Due to some bad history I avoided dating and he was my first. The guy is an airline pilot and gone for 17 days a month, which is fine  for my avoidant attachment style. He is good looking, smart and gets along with my family. Yet at a family event recently he got sooo drunk, he actually arrived dizzy, and told my cousin some very unkind things about his girlfriend. He called her a sl\*t (she is known for her past of sleeping around in this small community) and warned him that her fat a(ss) will get even fatter after she delivers a baby. Then he said that ""his woman has only been with him and even after she gives him a buunch of kids will not look old or gain weight"". Now, his woman is me. I found the wording very mean. And also to give him kids. Like a kid is something a wife give to her man?

I don't know what to think about all  his. He was soo drunk that he spent the night on all fours vomiting in the toilet. My cousin put him in the car and took him to my place. And now some  memories come to my mind. I am fit as I hit the gym daily. But during winter I gain a bit of a weight. He was not mean or anything but bought me some jeans that were small, to motivate me lose weight. He said it was a joke but not sure. Also, I am an elementary school teacher and I thought about changing the career for an office job. He wasn't against it but he said elementary school teacher is very nice for a woman.

"As the title suggests, I can’t get over a guy I dated over a year ago. We were in a “situationship” for 4 months so he was never even officially my boyfriend. 

Physically, he was everything I was looking for. I was a tan, short, bodybuilding, blonde (22in extensions). He was a 6’4 blue-eyed Italian with luscious locks. I think I was completely infatuated from the start because I told him I loved him after a month of knowing him. 

I kept imaging what it was going to be like when he finally asked me to be his. I made up our entire life story together and fantasized about all day long. I started getting annoyed that he wasn’t asking to be official and it drove me crazy. I started questioning him and begging for reassurance that he was into me. I asked what I needed to change to be with him 

Side note, he was addicted to c**e and op******. I completely dismissed that as an issue because I was so obsessed with him. 

Obviously, things ended horribly. It’s been over a year and I still think about him every day. I try to date, but I always compare people to him (even though he was kind of a loser). 

I need help. Has anyone been through this? Do you have any advice on how I can get over this and actually find someone? Take a break from dating and focus your attention on something else like a new hobby, new physical activity etc.

"I met someone last fall and we went out a couple of times. Both went great, we had lots in common and connected on multiple levels. We kept texting back and forth throughout the winter. I noticed that she would be very responsive and initiating things one moment and then suddenly would go quiet for a while.

We set up another date and then she ended up cancelling at the last minute. After that, I told her I was interested in her but it seemed like she had lost interest, so I was going to move on.

She said that she was in a ten year relationship which ended around 4-5 months before I met her. She had mentioned a past relationship during our second date, but I didn’t realize how long it was or how recent it ended and didn’t want to pry into the details at the time.

She apologized for not being more upfront about it and said that she thinks I’m nice and interesting guy but she realized she’s not ready to date anyone at the moment.

I told her I understand and asked if she wanted to go for a casual walk sometime not as a date. We ended up doing that and she thanked me for being understanding of her situation and said that we’d have to get to know each other as friends for now.

I realize that there is no standard timeline for recovering from a breakup… and even though she’s said she’s interested in me, it’s hard for me to trust it with all the emotions I’ve experienced since I met her.

I’ve tried to go on dates with other women, but I’ve been distracted because I’m thinking about her instead of the woman I’m on the date with.

I feel very stuck at the moment. I’m not sure if I should keep talking to her and inviting her out to do things casually or just move on… hence the Reddit post. Any recommendations? Move. On. [Practical Advice]"

"Basically the title. We had a long talk last night and one of the things he brought up was that he’s slightly less attracted to me now because I’ve gained weight. He referenced a picture he sent me a week ago and said my face looked different now (I assume he means it’s just not as sharp, I have noticed my face looking puffier too). 

When we met I think I was around 115-120 pounds. But now I’m about 135 pounds at 5’3”. I feel conflicted because I have a history of disordered eating and I know I’ve gained weight. I can see it and feel it in my clothes. But yet, I’m happy or the very least accepting of my body and glad with how my life is. And I told him this. I also listed other benefits of my weight gain: I’m no longer as cold even during the summer, my hands and feet aren’t cold all the time either, I have a little shape to my body now too.  

I understand that attraction isn’t something someone can control. My boyfriend treats me great otherwise. He didn’t tell me this begrudgingly but he brought it up in a kind way. But I don’t know how we can navigate this. I told him that I’m not at an unhealthy weight, I think I’m finally not underweight for my height. I’ve had a stressful last three years, and it’s going to be more stressful soon because my mother will be going through chemo (this information he does not know). I know I could tone up to look better but honestly it’s not my priority at the moment. 

I’m surprised that I’m not totally heartbroken by his confession. Instead, I see him slightly different now because my weight gain cause this change in him and that worries me more. I want to have more follow-up conversations but what do I say? How do I spearhead that conversation so our relationship won’t crumble from this? 
 I get what you’re saying but I would never feel safe with someone this shallow. If a little weight gain can make him less attracted then what about pregnancy, illness, ageing etc? That would be my concern. 

I also had disordered eating and Im also 5’3. I’m now just under 150 lbs and used to be 140. I look after my diet well and I exercise but I would never actively pursue weight loss again. Only health.  [Commentator's opinion]"
"Been dating this guy for six months and we had no problems between us. We had been doing long distance but I used to go visit him but he never took me to where he stayed.we always met in town .we had met a few days ago and there was nothing to warn me so I would say the day was good  .the next day some girl calls me and warns me to stay away from this guy and I was so confused. She insulted me and I was too mortified to talk so I just hang up on her. She texts me and all of it was just insults and I was angry so insulted her back. I called the guy the next day and he just said that what the girl said was true .I didn't even cry I just laughed because how much of  a coward was he that he couldn't tell me we were over . He texts me and says she is everything he ever prayed for and I didn't know what to say. I felt bad for a couple of days and talked to some friends and I was over him but now I am scared of ever dating again because I don't want to get hurt.. please advice..
And I still think about this guy sometimes but I don't miss him I just feel a pit in my stomach because I couldn't see the red flags
 This... was horrible and I'm sorry it knocked you down, but you CAN'T stay down. You have to get back up, collect yourself, and back out there. Because while it's true that the bar is in hell, there are good men out there. Most of us don't want to end up without a relationship and HE isn't worth being your last guy let alone the one that scared you off forever. That girl didn't inherit your man. She inherited your problem. Better it be done now than after 7 years or something insane like that. [Emotional Support]"
"im trying to find my man’s Reddit. I see from afar that he is always on it. Never thought anything of it, but he always has this look on his face that makes him look suspicious. And tonight I seen him on it again.
 
So I’m trying to find him but I’ve got no idea how I can search him up. Yea, I can ask him, but I just know that my simple questions can easily turn into arguments because he can’t ever simply answer and reassure me. So I want to look him up on my own. But it’s hard on here because his name, nor any other names show up 😩😩. Look very closely, become a fly on the wall. This is stemming from distrust, but sometimes when someone is secret about things it makes sense to not trust them. I hope you're able to find him.

Or talk to him about it 🤣🤣 [Commentator's opinion]"
"I 49/F was asked by a friend 32/F to be a bridesmaid in her wedding. I was actually her boss for a few years and we developed a close friendship that has continued for many years along with some mutual friends. She looks up to me and I love her to death. I reluctantly agreed to be in her wedding which is 9 months away. There are 10 bridesmaids. The talk of the bachelorette weekend is happening (big group text) and I truly don’t want to go. They are all significantly younger than I am, I’m quite introverted so staying in an Airbnb with 10 girls does not sound fun and the maid of honor who is planing is is a very high maintenance control freak so I’m already envisioning how this is going to go. I don’t think my friend would be upset if I didn’t go but I also don’t want to disappoint her. Should I just suck it up and go or should I regretfully decline?  She has plenty of time to find someone else with 9 months notice. Plus, 10 bridesmaids is ludicrous. I would suggest you graciously bow out from these activities and let her know that you believe this is best left to the younger members of the wedding party, and that you simply aren’t comfortable with these activities at your age. Tell her you absolutely want her to have a great time, but you will not be joining in. Honesty as soon as possible is the best policy. [Practical Advice]"
"So I met the girl online and I know thay have a thing for me and I've been iffy on how I show affection twords them and I thought I could like them back but no matter how much I try I just don't feel any emotional connection with them what do I do cuz their a good person and I've tried to like them back If you don't feel any emotional connection at all, then you should just tell the person that you don't think they are the right person for you without going into a lot of detail. Yes, it'll hurt them regardless of what you say, but better to end it decently than keeping someone on a string since it isn't going anywhere and they'll get over you and move on in a short time so don't hold back letting them know. You'll do both of you a favor by admitting the truth about how you feel. [Practical Advice]"
"Hi everybody. Sorry for the vague title, but I'm not really sure how to word this.

Basically, my partner always emphasizes very idealistic things that he'll do for me in the future/one day and uses that as leverage.

For example, my partner always says things like ""I'll buy you nice jewelry one day"" or ""I'll take you on a nice vacation one day.""  I'm not sure if he thinks that'll make me feel more excited/hopeful for the future, but it actually just makes me feel worse. In regard to the statements that he'll buy me something, I've never been much of a gift person, but because he makes those statements, I sometimes come to expect something and then become disappointed. Just recently he went on a trip, and he told me he would buy me some nice tea. Without him telling me prior, I would have never expected a gift, but of course, he didn't actually end up following through. I'm just so confused because why tell me something that I necessarily don't want to hear???? by telling me, I feel like he's just setting himself up for more failure and me for unnecessary disappointment?? this is a common pattern that has happened multiple times across a variety of themes.

While I feel like all his statements are super empty,  he often acts as if they're not. For example, we got into a bit of a scuffle the other day, and I said something that complained about how he never thinks of ""us"" and it's always just ""him."" In response, he retorted that he will move to my home country for me, something that i think is highly unlikely but he likes to daydream about i guess, so that's proof that he is thinking about ""us"" and willing to do things for ""us."" Additionally, even if we do move, that's like ten years away minimum, aka maybe too far away to be bringing up in arguments right now. 

I also feel that he's expecting that everything will just work out in the long run so he doesn't have any urgency to apply meaningful thought or real tangible effort to our relationship in the present, which makes me feel like he just expects that I'll stay with him no matter what because he has painted this idealistic future for us (which is not true). 

To be fair to him, I think he is only daydreaming about the future because he's going through a difficult time with his immediate family. but I'm wondering if 1. my feelings are valid, and that it makes sense to be frustrated at this sort of pattern, and if it does make sense, 2. how to go about communicating this to him in a way that's not an attack/harsh? and 3. how do I express that I would much rather appreciate some sort of effort in the present than to wait for a future that may never come? Do you realistically see a future with him? How would that work with a different country? 

At 24, you need to get more serious about your dating options. You need to date with a future and you are seeing and knowing this behaviour, and life obstacles won’t lead to it. [Practical Advice]"
"I (20M) have never had a girlfriend, am a virgin, and have only ever really been on a few dates in high school.

I want to try and put myself out there but really don’t know how. I’ve tried a dating app but half the time I don’t get responses. I feel as if I am decent looking and I am fit. I also have job stability being in the reserves and goals as I am a college student trying to become an officer. I don’t have any debt and I feel as if I am in a good financial state.

This might sound vague but what’s the best advice for trying to get started with dating as a young 20 year old? Not sure that alot of my peers consider the reserves as stable career prospects, but the fact your a student with a goal for some type of OCS or OTS is a good long term goal. Just be yourself, open to meeting people and making friendly. 

If you like someone, communicate that to them sooner rather than later and don't be afraid of the rejection. It just means it wasn't the right person or the right time. Also keep in mind many have opinions on the military that they may consider that a deal breaker. Try not to take that too personally or be offended of that's their reason for not wanting to date.

"I just randomly found a bra I don’t recognise under mine and my partner of 10 years (30m) bed and am freaking out and don’t know how to proceed.
Part of the problem is there’s a number of possibilities besides the obvious it could be.

1. It might be an old bra that i had forgotten i had. It does seem to fit me but I have no memory of it at all and it’s not really my style.
2. We had someone house sit for us a while ago and I think his girlfriend stayed over for a bit, so it could be hers. 

My partner is away until tomorrow. How do I confront him and figure out what’s going on? 

 Ask the friend if his girlfriend is missing a bra.  If it's a good one, she will want it back.  If it's not hers, then ...? [Practical Advice]"
"She’s also 28, I’ve known her since high school too but only started talking to her again two years ago, and only actually began seeing her in person this year.

As for why I’m a virgin, my life went to absolute fucking shit when I was 20.  I was in and out mental hospitals for years and I only just finished an associates degree last year.  I make 33 per hour which isn’t awful.  I’m a hard worker who doesn’t take corporate bullshitting though, so I got promoted fast.

This woman was my last loyal friend through these years.  Everyone else who wasn’t a family member kind of treated me like a damaged piece of equipment in the friend group (all my guy friends did that especially).  I got new friends eventually, thank God.  One more thing, if we had to judge her appearance, she is a straight up 10/10.  I’m not the only guy who thinks so, I’ve had other guys who asked to see her picture confirm it.  I’m worried I won’t have a shot if I’m a virgin but I really do like her and how loyal she’s been since literally 2012.

Help me decide here. I'd be fascinated to hear your plan to change that if you didn't. [Sarcasm]"
"Before suggesting breaking up, hear me out. I’ve been in this relationship for a couple of years and it is truly making me lose myself. I care too much, admittedly sometimes about very small and stupid things. We will fight about these small things constantly. I also care too much about seeing him whenever I can because we are long distance. I want to live for myself and not for this relationship as I feel like I’ve grown to be very codependent on him when he just prefers to be alone. I do have a few hobbies but I will still pick him over everything. I want to stop caring and stop chasing someone who is running away from me. So how do I start caring less about someone I love more than anything while having the complete intention of staying with them. Do you have girlfriends? Set times to hang out with them and try to stay off your phone / create space between you and your BF. Another way to do that is by doing your hobbies. Remind yourself you need independence. It makes you a better, more interesting partner. And, if things go south, it leaves you with a community to lean back on. You’re young and love feels soooo intense so don’t beat yourself up- it’s normal to be a bit obsessive at your age. [Practical Advice]"
"if you was asked by your boyfriend/ partner if you think they have a small penis would you say yes if you agreed or disagree not to hurt there feelings ?

"I am a 30F and I’ve been talking to a 25M for the past two months. We’ve been on 7 or 8 dates and they have all been going so well. Last night we went out to dinner and I slept at his place, like I have done many times before. We are extremely sexual and I have mentioned that I enjoy being choked during sex. He’s done it before and I’ve enjoyed it! This morning, we’re having a conversation in bed and are not in any position to start being intimate. The conversation was harmless but we started to debate a topic. After I said my side, he wrapped his hands around my throat for a few seconds. It didn’t necessarily hurt, but I was honestly shocked afterwards. I said he could choke me during sex and this was completely out of the blue….I brought it up later and said it really really concerned me. He apologized and said he would never hurt me and he didn’t mean it like that…should I give him another chance or run? That's a run moment.

Leading up...

* Okay, she talked about sex choking, she's into it.
* He did it before during sex and she liked it.

I was expecting this to be a situation where he just went for it during sex but did it with without warning this time. That's just a boundary readjustment. 

But nah.. To choke someone during a debate. That's a huge F no.

What happens during sex is irrelevant. To choke someone out of frustration that is statistically the most dangerous. [Practical Advice]"
"Me and my now ex have had a very complicated relationship. He has always been emotionally abusive in arguments and when we are not arguing he makes small digs at me that slowly eat away at my self confidence. When we argue he calls me things like a “failure” “weak” he will bring up all of my short comings and anything i’ve ever told him out of vulnerability. Recently we had a terrible fight and he said more horrible things to me and i got to angry i grabbed him by his face and I put my hands on him. He has also put his hands on me in some occasions which he says is not comparable to when i’ve find it because he did not leave me bruised and he felt remorse. I feel so terrible and now we are over. He is calling me an abuser and says we can never be together but i feel this is not fair. I do not feel justified in hitting him but i feel i was pushed to my limit. I hit him and had a panic attack and shortly admitted myself into the psych ward i have never felt such intense anger. I fear i have snapped and there is no going back.  No its reactive abuse. He is trying to break you down so you react negatively and then use that to portray you as the bad person so you feel guilty. 
There is two things either he wanted out and tried to make it your fault to hide his wrong doings.
Or he is manipulative, trying to make be tied to him by abandoning you.
Let him go he will make your life hell. [Practical Advice]"
"For context, my boyfriend (M/30) isn't in any kind of secret relationship with her. She's dating his close friend, and lives in a different state than us. 

The reason I (F/27) have an issue with him following her to begin with is she was being mildly flirty with him one night via a discord chat (boyfriend plays video games with his close friend & she happened to be there).

I'm not okay with that, so I shut it down and told him it made me uncomfortable. So, I noticed he recently started following her on Instagram, but that isn't the part that bugged me. 

What bugged me is he went back and liked every single one of her posts all the way back to 2018. He didn't comment, but he liked them. Point is, why?

So, the first time I told him I wasn't comfortable with that, resulting in him blocking her. Eventually he unblocked her and followed her again (like wtf?). This time I unfollowed her for him, only for him to refollow her again months later.

We've been together 10 years and he has a history of purposefully doing things I don't like (yeah, I know). Is this one of those moments? Or is there something else going on? 

I've checked his messages and he's not physically speaking to her, so what gives?   Girl, why are you with a man who *purposefully* does things he knows hurts you?? The issue here is you. You’re the one staying with someone who disrespects you and doesn’t care how you feel. You need to wake up and realize his behavior isn’t going to change and this is never going to stop. This man won’t even stop following a girl for you, instead he goes back years and likes all of her pictures. 

Please realize you deserve better than this. A man who loves you isn’t going to try to hurt you and upset you. He isn’t going to try to embarrass you by going back 5+ years on a girls instagram liking all of her pictures (which sends her a certain message). The right person for you is going to shut down flirty conversation without you even having to say anything. Relationships are not supposed to hurt you like this, I promise there is so much better out there. 

Regardless of if he’s inappropriately talking to her or just trying to upset you, both are horrible and say a lot about his character. [Emotional Support]"
"I've been with this girl for about a month. She kissed another man and said it was a dare that she had to do. She then added that its not okay if i did the same, and that if I did she would be really mad at me and she would do something.

"
So me (F22) and my bf (M23) had a great sex life in the beginning. Usually once a day and he was enjoying it a lot, initiating it the majority of the time. I already had some problems with being rejected back then so I felt really overwhelmed when he sometimes wasn’t that much in the mood. However, that was controllable. Now 2 years into the relationship, he seems to just don‘t want me sexually anymore. His libido got really low half a year ago but we thought it was because of his semester abroad. Now he‘s been back for over 2 months but nothing’s changed. He seems to be less interested in me everyday. I also try everything, putting on sexy clothes, wearing makeup, doing my hair, doing sexy stuff to get him in the mood. But even when it works he seems to not enjoy it as much as he used to. He doesn’t touch me in „awe“ anymore and seems to not be in love with me and my body anymore. He denies that this is the case everytime I try to talk about it but still nothing’s changing. So now I‘m thinking if I‘m just overdramatizing it? And just wanted to ask if anybody else had similar situations and how you cope with the extreme feelings of rejection. Yea know...life happens and we all get kinda tired. First..communication is key. Get on the same page.

Second...mix it up.

There was something so incredibly erotic that out of the blue.....the wife of 20+ years was legs spread masterbateing as i exited the shower. We locked eyes. I got insta hard and we did a mutual masterbateing session. We both came so damn quick watching each other masterbateing. [Practical Advice]"
"I’m in a long distance relationship for 4 years with my boyfriend. For a year I’m trying to plan to visit him but things keep getting in the way. I’m renting an apartment and a few months ago during a storm something happened to the balconies that couldn’t wait so I’m in the middle of a renovation in my house right now as we speak and I can’t leave. However in the meantime my boyfriend keeps pushing me to come and is setting dates and barely takes no for an answer. We had many arguments about this and I’m always being accused of being a liar despite us video calling and him witnessing all the problems at my apartment. Occasionally he has even broken up with me a few times saying he doesn’t want to wait, but always comes back to me anyway. This adds stress to the situation, and in the meantime I started to have health issues… thinking it was just from the stress I went to the doctor and they did bloodwork and it came back not good. Worst case scenario, I possibly may have cancer and I’m waiting for the hospital to contact me. I’m very scared. When I tell him I feel unsupported and all he cares about is what he wants he says it’s not like he doesn’t care, he just thinks I don’t have it because god wouldn’t do that to us. All day every hour he makes comments saying “that’s why you should come here, I wish you’d come here, when are you buying your tickets, you should really be here, buy tickets” and it’s so draining. Like he doesn’t understand that I’m waiting for a appointment in the hospital and that’s priority right now. It makes me feel so alone, unsupported and not seen. I don’t want to keep defending myself and talk about it all the time and keep explaining myself. What can I do?  Suggest he visits you instead. [Practical Advice]"
"Hey guys, so I'm in need of your experiences. There's this one girl in my life... She makes me think about her all the time, getting lost in her eyes or just fall in love with her laugh on a regular base. We have a good friendship together. But, atleast from my side, I feel and want more than just being in a friendship with her. There's this fear of what happens if I express my feelings to her - what if she says no? 

I can't think of how much the loss of this friendship will hurt me. Did some of you have the same problem? and how did you handle it?

"I am sorry ahead for some mistakes, English is not my first language.

I (21F) have been dating my boyfriend (21M) for 3 years. Over the past year, he has made 2 new female friends at his school. They would hang out after class and go for a lunch together (sometimes also with my BF's male friend as a group) and all four of them would also go out for drinks. Last week one of the girls wrote him and they spent half a day hanging out together and are planning a next meeting in July. (important info: she has a BF).

Despite this, I admit I am feeling jealous and it is putting a strain on our relationship (I am aware that this is my issue that I have to work on). I suggested to him that I would like to meet them, as I know it would ease my problem once I get to know them (also told him that). He was very hesitant, stating:

1. He doesn't know how to introduce me so it doesn't look forceful and awkward (his own words)
2. He doesn't view them as close friends/best friends yet, so he doesn't consider it necessary to introduce me.

Beside this issue, BF is very open and honest about everything and his friends know about me.

I would like to know your opinion on this situation, whether I am just overly jealous or I am in the right to feel unhappy about his stance on this matter. I get where both of you are coming from, him drawing a boundary with school connections is reasonable.

I think a fair compromise is that next time the group has drinks, you can drop in for a drink at some point, that allows him to introduce you in a casual way and leave together. That isn't overly intrusive, but it does let you see who he is hanging out with and also shows the group he is dating. [Practical Advice]"
"My fiance and I have been together for four years. When we first got together we had sex & did sexual activities all the time. We couldn’t keep our hands off of each other. Last October we got busy renovating our new home and working all the time that we weren’t as active. We moved in together in March of this year and I was so happy to get back to being a lot more active. Living alone you have all the time and freedom to do it WHENEVER WHEREVER. We never do tho. It’ll go 2-3 weeks without anything. No making out. No touching each other sexually. The only time we do is if he’s in the mood. I’m always in the mood. I crave it. I have tried everything. I buy lingerie. I walk around naked. I ask. I beg. I’ve talked about it to him countless times. Cried to him. I’m so lost on what to do? What is the problem? What else can I do? I’ve asked if there’s something else and he swears there’s not. I know where he is and he’s not one to go out. He likes to do everything with me. He’s not sneaky and im always able to check his phone if I ask but I have never ever felt the need to. This is so upsetting. I don’t want our relationship to be like this forever. I love sex and the closeness. No matter how much I say it upsets me he just says “sorry”. I need advice. Someone who can understand.

I’m assuming we will see each other for a 2nd date, but today she hasn’t text me for 8 hours and I’m getting tons of anxiety. I don’t know what to do with myself and i’m just anxious / sad staring at my phone waiting for a text. 

When monday hits I honestly plan on scheduling an appointment for therapy, I know this is probably not normal and I am either just extremely lonely or maybe something deeper.

"This occurred a few months ago, but I've been thinking about it a lot. One night, while having sex with my boyfriend, we were in the missionary position with my legs on his shoulders, which allowed for fairly deep penetration, though not deep enough to cause pain at the time. Immediately after, I began to feel a light pain on one side of my abdomen. The pain worsened when I got home, and I couldn't sleep because it was so intense. The next morning, the pain was still present, but it had become sharp. I was worried I might have appendicitis or something similar. The pain became so severe that I nearly went to the hospital, but fortunately, it subsided after taking a few painkillers. What do you think might have happened? I Googled it and found that I might have ruptured an ovarian cyst, but I'm not sure.

"So my fiancé (31M) and I (28F) are getting married abroad after nearly 4 years together. His psycho ex (34F) is known for harassing her ex’s, befriending their baby mumma’s and making false accusations to police. My fiancé has a child with her so sadly we have to deal with her tapped behaviours for many years.

The latest move she has made is to book to stay just minutes away from where we are having our destination wedding. She manipulates my stepson (8M) (the child she shares with my fiancé) and squeezes information out of him. The latest she has extracted from him is the exact place we are staying and where we are having our wedding abroad. Due to him coming with us she had to be informed of the dates we are taking him out of the country.

I hate the thought of going around the town and bumping into her, or my stepson requesting to spend time with her when we are away on our holiday for mine and his dad’s wedding. Even more so, I hate the fact she could turn up at the address we are staying at to try to put a dampener on what should be such a special occasion that we have waited so long for.

Honestly it makes me feel sick and really makes me think of what my future looks like if these are the lengths she will go to.

Just to add we are unable to change the location now due to non refundable deposits.

What would you do in this situation? I feel so sad about it and would be so grateful of any tips of how to deal with this situation. I would tell security (if you have them at your wedding) to not allow her in. [Practical Advice]"
"This is going to be a silly post but yesterday I got my first haircut in ~15 years. I’m a 27 year old guy and I’ve always been known for having really long hair and my hairstyle was honestly perfect for me— but I wanted to try something new out and so I took the risk and cut my hair. 

… big mistake and I went from hot to very very average. I’m going to take some time to focus on myself and just let my hair grow back out, but this honestly might be a good thing for my dating life? Maybe? 

I feel like dating as an attractive person is people seeing you (and making wild assumptions) more than actually getting to know you and this is going to sound extremely shallow, but I always see average looking people in relationships. The hot people that I know are all single or struggling to really find the right person. I’m not sure if that’s because there’s more options and so it’s a lot more weeding involved in dating. 

Maybe being average allows you to have one extremely compatible option that you see eye-to-eye with instead of several people that meet you and think they can do better or that you’re too good. Plus you don’t get immediately sexualized. 

I’m not sure, I’m kinda just typing and trying not too sound too shallow or crazy. 

But do you guys think that average people have an easier time dating than conventionally attractive people? 
 As someone who’s been both average (or worse) and well above average, I promise you it’s much easier when you’re attractive. Having a lot of people interested in you and then having to weed through to get the right ones is a much better situation than having hardly anyone interested at all. [Commentator's opinion]"

"Long story short, bf and I have been together probably over a year and after about 6 or 7 months he started staying at my place 5 days a week, only returning to his twice a week. 

I’ve never asked for his help with any bills or anything like groceries or rent. It would be nice for him to OFFER but his offers never go through. My rent is quite high yet I still pay for most of our outings when I can, and he’ll constantly reference my salary in comparison to his and our “tax brackets”. He also bought a dog and leaves it with me 24/7 as his place is too small. I hate it. I’ve voiced it. 

Two weeks ago I bought an apartment. I told him he can’t come over every day as I need to feel like the place is mine. He followed that with a rude comment about how he can’t date someone who’s always sad about going to visit their grandma in a retirement village (me lately as she has been suffering with dementia). This past weekend, he told me to “shutup” as a joke apparently in the morning when I woke up, told me I’m too lazy to do extra work at the gym (which apparently he knows because we “live” together) and then told me I would’ve been bad at my old job again as a joke apparently. Then kept commenting about my credit rating and my salary. Not sure wtf is going on but I feel like I’m not even able to celebrate this huge achievement of mine or feel like I can be myself without another rude comment coming my way about something. 

Help?  He’s being a dick to you because you’re thinking it’s something you’ve done, when it’s him just being an asshole. He is showing you who he is, and you’re thinking it’s your fault. It’s not. He’s just an asshole. 

You’ve been together for slightly over a year. So half that time he’s taken advantage of you financially, doesn’t respect you, makes fun of you for feeling justifiably sad, and makes fun of you for your job and salary. 

And it’s all happening because you’re letting it happen. You’re wanting him to change- which he isn’t going to do- instead of you seeing him for who he is. [Commentator's opinion]"
"Me and my girlfriend have been dating for 3 years, as of two nights ago we are on a break because she claims she doesn’t know if she wants anything serious, and needs to figure out what she wants, I expect I will be broken up with in a little bit here. This was my first relationship, my first actual love, she has treated me extremely poorly throughout most of the relationship, so originally I was not too distraught about breaking up, until I learned about the “man’s first love theory”, where basically every man never stops loving the first person they fell in love with, and I have since read about so many men who 5, 10, 20 years after breaking up with their first love they still wish they could go back to them, I even saw someone say that they were 40 with a wife and kids and still wish they were with their gf when they were 17. I am so scared this is going to happen to me, I do not want to compare her to every person that comes after her but I’m afraid I will, I’m afraid that losing her will ruin my life. Does anyone have any experience with this? Is this something I should be worried about? Or does everyone think this after their first break up?

TL;DR Breaking up with my first gf of 3 years who treated me poorly, Im afraid of the theory that every man keeps loving their first love their entire life. Is this true? Should I be scared? U shouldn't be scared it's not true. You have many loves in ur life the whole idea of first love is just romancized bs [Commentator's opinion]"
"I know it hasn't been that long, but the first 5 months of the relationship were amazing. We clicked really well off the start, we took our time and didn't rush things, and things were overall really good. Around 5 months in is when things between us got really serious, and is when I noticed she was acting strange. 

She does this thing where she'll text me ""good morning"", ""hey how are you"", etc., just casual things to check in and start a conversation. I will reply reasonably quick, however, she will leave me on delivered for like 3-4 days. Then she'll finally respond, we'll have a small conversation where she would seem very interested, and finally one of us would set up a date for the weekend. 

After 4 weeks of this she left me on delivered for like a week, even after I double texted her (this was the only time I did it). I finally texted her a third time asking her if everything was alright, because things have felt very off. She said she didn't know, but also felt she wasn't ready for a relationship. We had a quick phone call with no hard feelings and have gone on our way.

Basically my question is why would she text me first, then just leave me on delivered for days at a time? I know none of you can read her mind, or know the exact situation, but this has been confusing the hell out of me. If anyone has a similar situation, or a hunch at what the answer could be, please let me know. thanks

TLDR; After 5 months of a relationship, this girl will text first then leave me on delivered for days at a time. It has been confusing me and I want to know why she did that. Wait u go days or a week without hearing from ur gf? Bro this doesn't sound like a relationship [Commentator's opinion]"
"TLDR: I slept with the sister of my close friend's wife before I've met my girlfriend and she can't accept it. It looks like we are gonna break up due to this problem. Do you know what would help in this situation?  
  
As you might have guessed from the title, I slept with the sister of a close friend's wife. This close friend and I consider each other cousins, but it's important to note that we are NOT blood relatives.

The girl I slept with is rather promiscuous, not very smart, and definitely not a catch. When this happened, I didn't have much confidence and didn't consider myself much of a ladies' man.

I slept with her years before I met my girlfriend, but this really bothers her. We are together for 2 years, but now it looks like it might be over. She doesn't have much confidence and feels like I don't care about the type of girl I'm with. She doesn't believe that I wouldn't just sleep with anyone who comes my way anymore.

Of course, this isn't true, and I only desire my girlfriend. However, she can't seem to believe it. Whenever we have sex, she always thinks about what I did in the past, and it completely kills her mood. But I think this only happens after she orgasms because she always does. I suppose she wouldn't be able to if she were dwelling on it.

It's been an issue for over a year now, and unfortunately, it seems like we've said our final goodbyes. But I still have hope. I love her very much and am deeply attached to her. Today she told me she needs an assertive man. Well, because of our problem, I haven't been able to provide that for her lately.

I feel that if she had more confidence, this wouldn't be a problem, but of course, I can't be sure. Maybe that's not the case. What would you do in my situation? Do you have any ideas on how to overcome this problem? Do you think this can be fixed somehow?  Jesus dude did u have to drag the girl here for no reason? None of that was necessary to the story yet u still felt the need to attack? The fuck. [Hurtful]"

"22M

Just looking for advice on how to better accept my loneliness and the fact that I'm never going to be wanted. After years of trying and trying I've finally given up on dating and accepted that I'm incapable of being loved and nobody will ever want me. I asked out many girls, tried dating apps, went out on dates. All of it went nowhere for the last 5 years. 5 years of failure and rejection. I'm done. I get it. I'm worthless. I'm not allowed to be happy. I accept that. 
 
I Did so many things to try and improve myself and my desirability. I went to college and got a degree and got a decent job making good money for my age, got my own place, lost a lot of weight, got tattoos, bought a nicer, newer car since I was earning better money, put myself out there by hanging out with friends a lot, etc. Despite all this, I was still rejected all the time and have never had a gf. I'm done trying so hard for something I'll never have. I'm better off dead but I can't die for my familys sake. 

How do I better cope and accept this fate of mine? I've been looking into forcing myself to be apathetic and non caring anymore. Currently I just smoke weed and play video games to cope with things but it isn't working so great anymore. Any advice on this appreciated.
 I understand the frustration with unsuccessful dating. For me it comes in waves: sometimes I can deal with it better than other times. 

What really helped me was taking the pressure out of dating. I definitely have a desire for a family and marriage, which put enormous pressure on me. 

Keep going out on dates! Now that I view them more calmly, it’s taken the stress away. Sure it’s still frustrating when it doesn’t pan out, but it is easier to deal with. Try viewing them as just talking to some people without pressuring yourself. 

Sorry that you’re in this situation. Idk if anything I’ve said is even good advice. I haven’t found the one yet, but it surely helped me. Best wishes! [Emotional Support]"

"i absolutely adore and love this guy so much, we’re not officially in a relationship yet but we both say i love you and are loving with one another.

however i find myself having severe anxiety around him, i have social anxiety disorder, so maybe that’s it. but i hear a lot of people say that your body will tell you when someone ISN’T right for you. you’ll get stomach pain, break out, not get sleep, and your appetite will decrease.

i am hardly eating now, i get diarrhea a lot just from sheer anxiety, i’m breaking out, i can hardly sleep, and i have terrible stomach pain. he’s truly so wonderful and caring, extremely respectful and the whole nine yards, but with the way i feel i’m concerned it’s my body telling me he’s not right for me.

consequently when you’re with the right person you’ll be getting sleep, you’ll glow, your color will come back, etc.

what do we think? It sounds like you just plain have anxiety/ocd issues and no relationship is going to fix that. If anything a relationship will make you MORE nervous lol. [Commentator's opinion]"

"My gf and I have been seeing each other for about 8 months now, and I she told me from the beginning that she is horrible at decision making. 

Over our time together, there’s been a few occasions where it was easy for her to decide on something, but most often she cannot make a decision for the life of her. I’m not only talking about big life things, but all the way down to little things like what food to order and what to watch on tv. It stresses her out so much she begins to almost panic and have a some anxiety over it. 

It’s not all difficult for me to decide on things so it’s hard for me to relate, but it’s just wildly exhausting at times. Picking between a sandwich and a salad shouldn’t be as tiring as it seems to be. If she has having panic attacks over simple decisions like food and tv... That's probably above your duty. That seems like therapy and medication kind of spot.

Anyways, outside of that. You may be able to get her somewhere functional with some patience and hand holding.

With time, relationships are going to come with heavier decisions, you need her to stand on her own and contribute. You know how to critically think and make decisions, teach her that process.

My wife can be an overthinker and in constant need of my help for simple things.

I found a patient approach actually gets me somewhere with her.

The first time she asks for help, I demonstrate and explain.

The second time, I monitor and direct where needed, but I expect her to actually attempt it instead of me doing it for her.

By the third, she's got the hang of it and doesn't ask me about it anymore.

Additionally, maybe take a leadership role and simplifying the decisions for her.

For example:

>What do you feel like eating tonight?

Making it a wide decision for her to decide. That's where the trigger comes from.

Go:

>I feel like pizza or tacos tonight.

Narrowing it down. Then, same thing. Remove the open ended question where she has to decide.

>Anything against tacos? No? Okay... Lets have tacos.

That would be a good step 1 to achieve. Step 2, introducing open ended questions where she has to give you input. You're eventually going to need her to get to that spot for the long run. Otherwise you're going to carry the mental load always, relationships need each-others input. [Practical Advice]"
"I'm a friggin clean slate. I know NOTHING. I barely even have friends that aren't dudes. I need help getting started. I grew up in an household where emphasis was 1000% on school. safe to say, i ""wasted"" my time in uni in this regard where most date around and figure out what they want/need. I'm not a devoid of human contact per se, I'm still close with many of my friends, but I feel like theres a different kind of companionship shared with a significant other that I've  i've never experienced, but I feel like I am missing in my life.

looking for some advice from my fellow average dudes who had to get after it to find someone. 

questions i have are:

1. how to get into the dating scene
2. what are some/kind of places and activities that are conducive to finding potential dates
3. if i find a girl im potentially interested in, how do you approach without being creepy
4. how/when do you ask a girl out
5. whats the difference between dating and relationship
6. what're realistic expectations of dating and relationships
7. do I do the apps? i heard they suck
8. am i just approaching this all wrong

dont drink, party, or club. not my scene

TL;DR average asian dude has never gone on a date and wants not end life being literally forever alone Downside is that the dating market is pretty brutal right now. Many women are dating/screwing like Harvey Weinstein these days. We shot past the goal of equality and went straight into reverse toxic masculinity. If you're just getting started, the first thing to figure out is what your goal in having relationships is going to be and then not to date anyone that has a different goal. Better to be single than to get laid by a girl who's going to use you and then abandon you after you fall in love with her. [Commentator's opinion]"
"The meme is the one where people say, when Asian women date outside their race it’s only white guys. 

Just want to make it clear that I don’t believe in making generalizations about people. I don’t use the meme and it’s just something I keep running into online. Also I hope that this doesn’t turn into a type vs fetish conversation lol. For simplicity let’s just say external factors are the reason why I have a type. 

For context I’m a hispanic male in mid 20s. Like I know that it’s extremely common and there is nothing wrong with it. But I also realize that an extreme generalization about people does not apply to everyone. Since I know of people that break the stereotype. I’ve also been involved in situations that go against this stereotype.

I feel in my case there have been a couple instances where things don’t work out for an unexplainable reason. Then the brain looks for random things that could explain why things did not work out. Perhaps getting off the Internet will be helpful. [Commentator's opinion]"

"i (25f) have been dating a guy (25m) for 7 months consistently. 2 nights ago (saturday) we had plans to see each other but he got off work later than anticipated so we decided to wait until the following day. he told me he’d call me before bed. he never called me and i called him a few times and he never replied which was weird. he texted me yesterday morning (sunday) saying that he had just fallen asleep etc. later in the afternoon yesterday (sunday), we were out and i noticed a small spot on his neck that looked like a hickey. he denied it being a hickey but i kept pushing him and he eventually told me that he had slept with someone else, the night before (saturday). my entire world shattered in that moment and i was inconsolable. 

we have spent nearly every single day together for the last 7 months. his justification was that he’d rather “get it out of his system now” because he “wants to be with me long term”. i don’t even know what to say. i am crushed. i have been crying to the point where i can’t breathe for the last 12 hours. he keeps telling me how he “likes me so much and wants a serious future with me hence why he did this now before things continue to progress”, but that’s BS to me. we have already invested 7 months into one another. i can’t even fathom him inviting another girl over and having sex with her while i laid in bed calling him just bc i wanted to hear his voice before i fell asleep. i am crushed. genuinely, i have never felt so much emotional pain in my life.

i keep picturing him inside her and i can’t eat, i can’t sleep, i can’t focus, i cannot stop crying. he shattered my heart. my question is, how do i move forward? how do i make sense of his “justification” for sleeping with someone 7 months into our relationship? he knows i have a history of being cheated on twice prior and this just feels like the biggest betrayal of them all. the mental imagine of him making love to another woman in the bed he’s held me in for 7 months has me in sheer agony. i feel beyond broken. Beautiful girl. I have been in this place. As hard as it is, when you have your strength back, it might take you days/weeks but I hope you leave this man. If he can do this now, it won't get better, although he will say it will. If he loved you enough we wouldn't risk losing you to get something out of his system. In fact he wouldn't need that at all. These men never learn esp when girls stay and basically allow them to get away with this behaviour and or excuses. Take the time you need though, you may not be able to do this right now and that's ok. At the moment it's just grieving and survival. Do you have friends you can lean on?

I'm just wondering if it's something I should be straight forward about to possible matches, and if it might be something that might be a red flag or just a turn off in general.  You don't openly tell anyone. If they ask then maybe you can tell them. Women may judge and will consider it a red flag and a turn off more so then if the roles were flipped.

"I (F, 28) and Husband (M,25)  have been together 4 years and  don't know what the problem is. I just get completely disgusted when we kiss, touch, have sex. This has been going on for about 2 years. We have been together for 4. When we first got together, it was like rabbits. For the last 2 years, I don't like the feeling of sex itself, I don't like even being touches. It's gotten worse recently.  It's crazy because romantically I find him intoxicating. I love him so much for who he is, but I'm not equally attracted to him sexually, i think. I don't know if it's him specifically or sex in general. I went to the doctor about it. I've only had sex with one other person and the feeling was similar.  My doctor suggested porn together and masturbation but it didn't really work. Any suggestions or thoughts? First, find a new doctor. Then find out if you have a hormonal imbalance.

So I am really curious, if u have commitment issues, what is it exactly that you are afraid of? What is the fear? 
I would like to understand more about it!  I honestly don’t know. I tried dating couple of people. But at this point of my life I’m afraid of being the high effort guy for bare minimum. I see a lot of couples in my life where the girls/wife’s do a lot for the relationships: initiative affection, calls, kisses, organize events and so on. And the guys do 1/10th of effort at best while still acting entitled .

"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years and we have lived together for 7 months. We have had a LOT of issues in our relationship, mostly done by him and his addictions. I’ve decided to stay and help him get through his issues, even if that means hurting myself in the process. 

There has been porn addiction and online sexting that has happened throughout our entire relationship up until February when I found out. Because of this, I am extremely cautious and a little self conscious about myself and the way I look. 

Yesterday, he showed me a text from his friend. It was a gif. When I looked at the entire screen, his friend sent him a video of women in lingerie dancing with light sabers (my boyfriend is a big Star Wars fan). My boyfriend’s response was “we need to go to the strip club lol”. 

We went to sleep after. Today he asked me what was wrong; and I said “I want to tell you, but you’re going to be annoyed.” And he said “just tell me”. So I told him seeing that text made me uncomfortable and I didn’t like that his friend felt okay with sending him a video of women in lingerie dancing. And I didn’t like his response, as I’m not okay with him going to a strip club or entertaining other women.

He immediately got defensive and started cussing saying “I’m never going to the fucking strip club, if anyone texts me like that I will respond with ‘fuck you my girlfriend doesn’t like these texts. Loose my number you piece of shit’ I know you hate this friend and you told me you never want to hang out with him again. I only talk to him at work and he sometimes texts me weird fucking shit”. I started holding my hands up because he was borderline yelling and I stood up and he said “you know what. You stay in here I’ll fucking go downstairs”. 

I almost feel bad for being upset because he didn’t intend for me to see that part of his texts (I wasn’t going through his phone, he was holding his phone, I just read the entire screen). I know that’s a “guy” thing to do but he’s 40 and has hurt me and my ego countless times by entertaining other women. 

Mind you, I was calm. I know I should have said something yesterday when it happened, but I also attended my grandpas funeral yesterday so my emotions were all over the place. I knew he would get annoyed which is why I don’t like to tell him what’s wrong with me, and he proved me right. I don’t really know what to do or how to go from here. I ended up taking a bubble bath and the bathroom door is closed. What should be my next move?  Girl you're dating a man child. GTFO now bc you can't fix him. Focus that attention on yourself and your own happiness..there is a reason men like that can't date women their own age and it isn't bc he chooses to [Practical Advice]"
"Hi Reddit,

I'm in a really tough spot right now and could use some advice. My boyfriend (25M) and I (25F) have been together for over three years. We both have a strict no-clubbing policy to avoid anything that might jeopardize our relationship. He recently moved to Italy, and I'm in Asia. During the early stages of our relationship, I went to a few parties because my friends forced me. He made a huge fuss about it and even threatened me, despite knowing I’m not a party person.

Fast forward to now, he shared his iCloud ID with me so I could help him fix his LinkedIn and make professional accounts on Behance. While doing this, I saw videos of him at a club, zooming in on girls, and also noticed verification codes for Tinder and Hinge on his email. When I confronted him, he got furious, accused me of being suspicious for no reason, and claimed it was an old video his friend shared with him.

I know it wasn't an old video because the event took place last night, as confirmed by his Google Maps location. He also mentioned that boys do this kind of stuff and share it with their friends, but the timestamps on the videos were just 15 minutes apart. This is making me very suspicious.

Additionally, he's been going to pubs where girls are apparently asking him for hookups, and he's receiving emails from OnlyFans. I'm devastated, and my mind keeps replaying that video. My hands are shaking, and I'm having panic attacks. I don’t know how to process this or what to do next.

Any advice on how to move forward and confront him would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you. You can't move forward from that.

You two had a strict no-clubbing policy. 

And you couldn't have more proof... 

He's also on tinder, onlyfans, etc... LDR

She says that she has plans with her friends, so does that mean I'm a back up guy someone she could use for companionship because she has no one to talk to about her feelings apparently she text me recently that she misses me and she wants to see me have supposed to hang out Friday to go on a date, but she canceled Last minute because she was sick from her stomach for my bullshit because the day before she went to a friend she hasn't seen came into town so yeah what do you guys think? Just think I'm getting used or use as a back up guy because I feel like if she only wants to hang out during the night or during the day she probably embarrass me because she might be in a relationship with someone because I don't think I'm bad looking I'm sick too. I go to the gym. I work out I play for.
I'm pretty funny most people said and I'm pretty cool to hang out. What are you guys think? I'm being used or not How long have you been dating with this girl? I do think it’s kind of a red flag that she hasn’t just included you in her plans with her friends. 
When my boyfriend and I started dating, I wanted to see him as much as possible. sometimes I had plans with my friends and instead of standing him up, I asked my friends if it was okay if he came.

When he told me he still wants to explore having sex with someone else I was initially cautious but open to it because I thought I/we were mature enough to do this and that it would be one time but honestly its been an emotional rollercoaster and I am not sure if I can last the relationship. He is currently away on a big trip and we had discussed and decided that this trip is where he will do his 'exploring'. I thought if it were contained in a place far away I would be able to cope better but it's been really hard.  Sometimes I am so upset / angry that I am compromising my values and sometimes I feel okay. I feel like I've finally decided to move in and settle down with him and he has decided he wants to explore which in my mind does not feel like he is committed to me and this relationship. A lot of thoughts in my brain include what if this isn't a one-time thing, what if I resent him forever? He has been my first and only boyfriend and it is terrifying to think of starting all over again when I have finally made the decision to settle down with him. 



This has been something hard to discuss with close friends and I feel like no one has been through anything similar. I'm so conflicted and could really use some advice / other perspectives     You guys will need major couples counseling after this. [Commentator's opinion]"
"You can scroll through my previous post about the history of my father but a quick rundown. Since I was young he used to show me this woman and do a shh motion to indicate I shouldn’t tell my mom. They ended up getting a divorce and towards the end of my parents marriage he wasn’t even trying to hide it anymore. She was the other woman. He brought her over to our country and started a life with her. She’s defo younger but not sure by how much. Anyways. My brother M22 was raised quite oblivious to why our parents marriage ended. Hes always been protected in that sense. In life in general tbh.

Meanwhile from young I got exposed early to porn, my father’s affair and PTSD from loud noises of my parents arguing. Life was never stable for me since.

Anyways fast forward to today. The dust has settled a little bit since all that stuff went down. Till I went to visit my father. I saw her stomach swollen up and he told me he had news. My heart just sank and it felt like I had been kicked in the stomach. He saw my blank look and started frowning and provoked me to answer. I told him about my concerns that he’s getting old, and needs to be more careful but more about the fact that I feel like this child is his way of getting revenge on “his old life” whenever he sees us I know he’s reminded of his failed marriage, and this is his way out. I told him that we barely have a functional relationship as it is and now he wants to bring a new kid into the world, it’s a recipe for neglect. 

Even as well when it comes to things like money and child support cos I have a younger sister too, he’s very inconsistent with that and it’s always a problem for him, now a whole child??? We’re never gonna see a penny. As if it already wasn’t hard enough. I don’t see him very often cos life gets in the way and college. But idk maybe I’m being spiteful. The other woman said to me “what do you want me to do remove it?”

I’m currently sat in my brothers car busting into tears and not sure what to do, how can I make my father see it from my point of view? Here's what you do- double down on being an adult. Study, earn money, be sure your sister has what she needs as best you can, and live your best life. 


Set some healthy boundaries so you can thrive. You know exactly who your dad is. Move on and heal.  [Practical Advice]"
"My girlfriend and I are in a huge fight right now.
We've been together for two years and love each other but keep fighting over little things. She was mostly saying I should change how I did some stuff. I'll be honest: I really should work on many things and have been trying to. It's just that I seem to always fall back into the habit of doing those things again. She tells me about them by not saying anything many of the first times I do it or getting mad and just saying it's okay when I ask about it. Then we talk about it, and it blows up because she's been holding it in for so long, and it's not making her feel good. I keep telling her that it would work so much better if she told me upfront when I did those things to knock it off, but she's telling me she does, and she doesn't understand what l'm saying. She doesn't bring them up the next day or way later after I've done whatever l've done. She doesn't mention many specifics about what I did (sometimes she does). When she tells me about it after the fact, I try to look out for it, but I don't realize it's happening until it's too late and we have the conversation again. One time, she glared at me when I talked over her. I had a habit that annoyed her, and every time she glared at me, I recognized the problem and almost completely stopped. Back to the argument, she says she does tell me right after, but she doesn't. She waits until we are together anymore at home and texts me about it. She says she's ""not confrontational,"" but I don't think letting a partner know what they're doing is wrong, especially when I asked for it as confrontation. I understand it's frustrating when you keep bringing something up and nothing changes but i'm trying to tell her a solution and she's telling me she doesn't understand. How do I tell her that communication should be constant when she doesn’t believe? She is not your mother. She should not have to communicate every goddamn time you do something if you tell her you'll stop doing it. Stop doing it. Don't rely on her to keep reminding you. She's tired of it, of course she's pissed. [Commentator's opinion]"
"My fiancé and I are currently on vacation together with our 10 month old and I need some clarification. 

We were getting back in the car after a walk and I asked for my water, he gave me a water bottle and I took a swing out of it. He then realized that was his, but before giving me mine to me he said he needed to make it half and half so he took a swing out of my water before giving it to me. I was in shock. But this behavior is normal coming from him. 

Is this normal? 
He said he grew up in a way that his parents always did half and half with his sister. 
He wants half and half with everything, and I just think that doesn’t work in a relationship. 

Any advice? Do I need to be more open minded to how he grew up or will this never work and I need to ask him to change his perspective of things? 

 That’s….bizarre. 

I mean, it’s common behavior for young children to want everything to be equal and fair. I can recall my mom lining up 3 glasses to pour juice in and we kids would be there making sure it was equal. But he is 32 FFS not 5. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I met someone on a dating app 2 months ago and since then, we've been on 3 dates. We haven't seen each other for a month now and talking to him over the phone is shit. He's a dry texter, and I mean DRY. He replies once a day. He said he prefers talking in person, which I did notice from those 3 dates. I should mention that we met on an adult dating app, which basically are just for hookups, fwb's, etc. But, on those 3 dates, nothing really happened. It was just a wholesome and fun hangout/date for me but I enjoyed them. We haven't talked since last week when I tried to make plans (for our next day out) and he said he wanted to rest instead. Personally, I understand that, but I can't help but overthink this as him not wanting to go out with me anymore?

I recently got on another dating app (a real dating app this time) and I came across his profile. I know he has a profile on that app as he's told me before so i wasnt surprised. I was just wondering if it would be okay to start another (dreaded) conversation with him and tell him that I came across his profile on that app? Or would that be too creepy? or desperate? or what? I mean you had to create an account and go up there to even see it. Idk what you plan on getting out of bringing this up. I would just not mention it. [Practical Advice]"
"Dating for 1.5 years and intimacy has been very minimal because “antidepressants took his sex drive”. We were semi open because we always agreed sending nudes was not an issue. As for physical encounters we could talk about it.
He knows I am not asexual but that I am waiting for him and his times with his own self journey.
We are on a trip for Pride parade. Something he always wanted to attend to but never could, last week he was sad we couldn’t come because I am in a difficult moment money-wise. He told me how sad he was and I immediately spent money I don’t have on the trip. 
Went clubbing, got drunk, came back and I checked his phone while he slept and found out texts from last week.
The day before the infidelity happened he had told me he could not invite me to his house because his room was messy.
Then in the texts I found he offers his house for the hookup, went to pick the guy up at 3am and returned him at 6 and even paid him. 
At 5am he texted me he was watching a movie. I am repulsed at the thought he was watching it with the guy on his bed.
I’ve been distant all day. We go back to our city tomorrow and I don’t know if I should talk about it now and end the trip in a weird way, or wait until we are home. That guy has you but won’t have sex but has no problem buying sex? You should be grateful you haven’t been fucking this dude. I am sorry he has been leading you on for nothing, idk what this guys endgame is with this relationship with you if he doesn’t want to be serious, you should just dump him when you guys get back or leave ahead of him [Emotional Support]"
"Hi! So I’m 19 years old and I’ve been on dating apps for about 9 months now. I’ve been on about 30 first dates with 30 different guys. About 10 of them have turned into longer flings  (4-7ish dates). But every situation has ended after about 3 weeks. I’ve never had something last longer than a month. (I’m not sleeping with any of these guys) but It’s still very draining on my mental health to constantly go through the spiral of getting my hopes up on a new guy just for it to end like the rest of them. I can’t help but think something is wrong with me and it’s an emotional spiral that I don’t know how much more of it I can take. I know the easy answer is to get off the apps but I want to be in a relationship, I just don’t know how much more of the ups and downs of dating I’m able to take. And any new guy I start talking to, I just think to myself that he’s gonna end up like all of the rest of them. Is this a normal experience? And how can I protect my mental health going through this process? yeah its a normal experience. im a little older and no longer get excited with new matches. most of the time the women dont respond, take forever to respond(days). if they do, its a dry conversation and all they do is answer questions.

"I’m starting to search for a more longterm thing, would i be fooling myself if I get intimate early on like I have when looking for casual fwb type relationships? Like first through 3rd date is that going to either only attract people looking for casual stuff or like put me in a box where I won’t be seen as a good candidate for a girlfriend? But on the other hand, if someone is looking for something more serious and I don’t sleep with them early on then will they think we are not compatible? Some people think you gotta get the emotional stuff started or a good friendship basis. How true has that been for y’all? No it doesn’t but you should hold off on it if you’re genuinely looking for a serious relationship 

This way you can sift through incompatible partners BEFORE getting feelings involved [Practical Advice]"
"I have been with my bf for about 3 years,we met on a dating app when we were freshly 18. Throughout the years he has had a lot of home life issues which caused him to be jobless and homeless for a bit. He is a good man but just seems to have been dealt with the worst cards in life. Here’s my issue, he moved in suddenly with me and my folks about a year ago. We agreed to split the bills and rent as long as he worked. He had a job for about 6-7 months then quit and went on a trip with his friends. I embarrassingly lent him money for the trip since he didn’t have enough to cover his half. He didn’t get a job till about 4-5ish months later. Which left me paying for just about everything, Including his half of rent. He unfortunately didn’t have any money saved either, even after being payed weekly. He used daily pay constantly even after I expressed my concerns with his financial decisions. I love him very much but I think its finally time to break it off. The thing is that I worry about where he will go after if I do break up with him. He has no nearby family(family moved out of state and are estranged) and I worry about his mental health. Financial problems have been a constant strain in the relationship, I work a decent job and make enough for us to scrape by but it has been starting to eat away at my savings. Even at the beginning of our relationship ive been the one paying, even when I only worked for minimum wage. I understand how expensive moving out can be and I worry that I’ll just be putting him out on the streets. I try my best to understand how he must be feeling about our current circumstances but I feel as if it’s costing me my mental health and well being. How do I approach this with him?  You guys are so young and you don't owe him figuring out his life for him. We are all responsible for ourselves. You have already done more than enough housing him and paying for his rent/letting him live with you.

Do you see yourself with him long-term? Don't allow any guilt on what cards both of you were dealt with and just do what's best for you. Anything could happen in the future, and you may regret allowing him to take advantage of you for so long. [Emotional Support]"
"Me (male 21) and my partner (female 21) has been together for one and a half years. It is my first relationship and we spend all our time together since we are both in the same uni. The two of us would spend so much time together that both of our social circles diminished. One the extreme end, for me in particular, I have been trying to avoid socialising or even keeping in touch with my close friends for months. Before my relationship with my partner, I'm the sort of introverted person who would enjoy their time alone, but would still crave for social interaction periodically depending on my mood, as I enjoy making new friends, getting to know them and forming meaningful bond with them. But for the past 3 months or more, I haven't had the slightest motivation to talk to anyone but my partner. I even started ghosting my closest friend from all the way back in high school, it almost feels like a chore to talk to anyone but my romantic partner.   
  
I know this sounds very unhealthy, and it really is. Now I'm barely in touch with any of my friends. To them, it probably felt like i fell off the surface of the earth lol. My social life has been damaged to a point where I basically don't have anyone to hang out with and worst of all, I DO NOT WANT to talk to them despite knowing how problematic is it to not have a social like beyond your partner. But i genuinely do not want to have fun in the absence of my partner because it makes me feel guilty whenever i do have fun without them. For example, if i am part of very enjoyable conversation, I would constantly wish that my partner is here and it would sometimes make me feel extra guilty (it almost feels wrong) whenever I sense myself starting to enjoy a conversation or someone's company. In a fucked up way, it almost feels like I'm cheating on my partner by having fun without them. Therefore I sometimes find me unconsciously disallowing myself to have a social life outside my relationship. 

Why am i feeling this way? has anyone else felt guilty for making new friends/having fun when your romantic partner is not around? How can I stop feeling this way as it is obviously very unhealthy? 

Please help, need advice! This sounds incredibly co dependent. This sounds like u need therapy. [Hurtful]"
"We’ve been official for about 3.5 months but dated and knew each other before that, we both love each other and it was such a perfect relationship, and even though we argued very rarely about things it was always calm and kind and led to a deeper understanding of each other. A few days ago we had a big fight based on a lack of understanding of each other, and it led to us explaining to one another why we feel the way we feel and made us so much closer. But the fight scared me and left me feeling like I was taking the blame for all of it when in reality the whole situation was bad and truly blameless. Because I’m stupid and immature I started to try and blame her for the fight because I couldn’t handle the fault for it even though she never even blamed me, I just felt like she did. This ended up hurting her and didn’t even make me feel better, it just made me realize that I have a lot of problems that I need to fix. Because I didn’t feel better and I was stressed about everything that I needed to fix I was super irritable and felt like I was getting mad at her, and I didn’t know why and she felt it and it obviously hurt her, and I tried so hard to explain it to her but I just couldn’t because I didn’t understand it at the time. Eventually after a long time of thinking and writing down everything that I feel I managed to understand why I felt the way that I did, and I only felt irritated by her because I was so overwhelmed and stressed out by so many things that were centered around her, but weren’t any fault of her own. So while I was hurting her because I couldn’t put my feelings aside, she was comforting me and talking me through everything and trying to understand me and fix me and make everything work. And I kept telling her how sorry I was for hurting her and how horrible I felt for not being able to put my feelings aside and just show my love for her, but for some reason she forgave me and comforted me and still loved me and so now I feel like the biggest pos right now and I have no idea what I can do. She loves me so much and she’s so kind and caring and good and she’s an angel and I hurt her and I know she forgives me but I put a lot of strain on her and on our relationship and I just have no idea how to fix this. Bro this text was convoluted as fuck! It seems like you have a hard time figuring out how you feel when dealing with negative emotions, and/or managing them. You are aware of it, which is a good start though. My advice for you is to tell her you are sorry and think about a way to digest stressors in a more effective way. You can even ask her for help, although you shouldn't rely on it (i.e. help is good, responsibility not so much). You probably need some space to process everything before actually reacting.

"Got broken up with after a month and a half of a relationship. It was great and we were having a great time getting to know each other. Then all of a sudden,  He was panicking about the future and was freaking out about the prospect of getting married. I assured him that I wasn’t trying to marry him  or move in with him and that I liked him but that was not on my radar at the moment. He seemed assured at that comment initially but still freaked out about it and ended things.  I never mentioned the future once, but he made me feel like I was trying to put a ring on it. I can’t think of what I could have done for him to act like this. Why would a guy freak out about marriage so early into a relationship?   You sound like a stage 5 clinger.  Just kidding.  Who cares, good riddance to the bozo, bullet dodged. [Hurtful]"
not a lie title sounds as bad as it is 😂 context she came home early i had tank top on and a pair of knickers 🤦‍♂️ realistically is it over between us ? i’m 22 and she’s 25 been together 2 and a half years  The fictional stories belong in a different subreddit. [Sarcasm]
"So I just went on a date with this girl who was really nice and friendly, but I didn’t really feel a romantic interest in them kind of a friendship feeling? Not sure if it’s because of the date location being a theme park or if it’s how I feel. 

She’s transferring colleges to another state later this year so I also almost don’t see the point in trying to get to know her if she’s leaving? Am I wrong for thinking that? 

Idk what to do, she’s really nice and I don’t want to hurt her feelings, but I also am not sure if going out again is a good idea? Are you looking for a “spark” to feel some kind of rush or fill some kind of void in yourself?  It can be challenging to find good genuine people, she seems to be one. There is no harm in going on a 2nd date if you generally enjoyed her company. Maybe she felt a friend vibe too and it will be just that. Sometimes first dates are awkward. If it’s an absolute “no” for you then it’s probably best to let her know you aren’t interested in seeing her again. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I (22F) have been talking to this guy (21M) for about a week and a half. I’ve met up with him twice, our personalities mesh well, we text everyday and he always wishes me a good morning. I asked him on Wednesday if he was free to meet up on Sunday. He said “hell yeah”. So on Saturday I texted him to confirm the plans for Sunday and he said that “something came up” and he ended up hanging out with some of his friends that were leaving for college to take summer classes. While I understand that we only recently just met and I am not a priority, I can’t help but feel upset by this. He ditched me knowing we had made plans, didn’t apologize for the sudden change of plans, and didn’t offer an alternative date to hang out. I’m not sure if I’m being overly sensitive or if my feelings are proportionate to the situation.  You’re not being overly sensitive. Take it as a sign to not get too attached. Make sure you have your own hobbies and make sure to change plans on him too. [Practical Advice]"
"So long story short, 6th of june we had unprotected sex. She is on birth control.
The thing is she is not really consistent with the BCs cause she always goes to volleyball training and ends at the evening and once she arrives home, she is too tired to even do anything she just sleeps. She would take the pill she missed on the next day and then yeah.

Now, she just had a breakthrough bleeding (spotting) and we are both anxious cause of the “what ifs”

I didn’t finish inside her so it lessens the chances.

She doesn’t wanna take a pregnancy test because shes too scared to.

Her last period was 17th of May to the 23rd of May.

Women of TikTok what does it mean? If she cannot take the pill in the evening why isn’t she taking it in the morning… 

Take a test. That’s how you find out. [Practical Advice]"

"My ex and I had an amazing relationship. We were both head over heels for each other. We dated for just under a year but had a serious relationship. We had talked about kids (including names), where we would buy our house, living together, and even a proposal/marriage (including where/when we would be married). 

8 months ago we broke up after living together for a month. She essentially didn’t see me a life partner over some things I did, mainly not fixing her toilet at midnight when I was already asleep, going to bed later then her, and being on my phone at breakfast a few times. I honestly think their was more to it, something deeper either consciously or unconsciously that drove her to break up with me. She wasn’t able to communicate it to me well. When we broke up we both walked away. Nether of us really fought for one another. 

10 days after breaking up with me she started dating her ex from 8 years ago (who cheated on her). They are now in a serious relationship and she’s again talking about marriage, kids, a house with the new boyfriend (they have been together for 6 months). She told me that her current relationship has a lot issues and barriers they are trying to fix. But she has been texting me a lot, probably 400-500 texts between the two of us last week. I don’t know if this is a sign she’s into me, being friendly, or keeping me as a back up. 

The other issue was that her parents were incredibly rude and disrespectful to both my self and my family, which would be a barrier we would have to discuss/talk about.

Don't.

"Background: 
My girlfriend and I have been dating since we met in orientation week of undergrad in 2017. We broke up in Nov 2020 due to a variety of reason but mainly centered around both of our poor coping strategies from childhood trauma. 

We rekindled our relationship in Jan 2023 after working on our problems apart. After dating long distance for 6 months we moved in together. 

The relationship has been mostly harmonious but there has been two issues that have been getting worse recently. 

The problem:
The first is that her ADHD has created a dynamic where I feel like I have to constantly keep track of housework/chores/bills as her executive disfunction prevents her from reliably self starting activities. This has lead to fatigue and burnout on my end and a dilemma of struggling to moderate my negative feelings as I do understand this is a disorder she also is dissatisfied with her inability to keep on top of her tasks.

The second is that her financial literacy is slowly draining me. After we broke up she dropped out of undergrad but still took on $19k in student loans. Mind you, I worked multiple jobs concurrently while in undergrad to only take $7k of student loans that I’ve paid down to a balance of $1500 after graduating. 

This gets into the bulk of the issue which is her financial literacy. The problem is that she has not paid any of it back and regularly will spend her checking account down to nothing and need me to send her money to keep her from over drafting. 

If it was legitimate needs like food I would understand but from what I see, she has a clothing shopping addiction and spends over what she can afford. She has stated to put $600 of clothing on affirm, and regularly thrifts for cloths even though our bedroom is overrun  with her clothing she already has. 

Once she gets her paycheck I would say she repays about 60-80% of what she needed me to cover but simply put she doesn’t earn enough to reliably cover her lifestyle. 

To her credit she is usually good about paying her portion of rent and bills but she only does so retroactively after it’s all due which means I’m on the hook to have the money needed to cover everything up front which has been hard lately with the cost of everything going up. 

Conclusion: 
I really do love her and want to stand by her doing anything I can. However, her lack of action to address these issues is slowly making me feel like a servant in the relationship. Sometimes I wake up in panics thinking about how if we get married then I’ll probably be on the one paying back her student loans while also being the only one trying to save up for our shared goals such as buying a house. 

TLDR:
How do I get her to take her financial literacy more seriously? Multiple things going on here.

1- you are carrying the weight of the emotional labour in the relationship, of course you’re burnt out. 

2- you are also carrying the financial load in the relationship, which isn’t fair, impacting your finances to the point she is taking advantage of you. 


First & foremost, she needs professional help to determine her ability to function & if she needs medication to aid in her ability to function. Hopefully she can overcome her shopping addiction with professional help, but she also needs to put in an active effort to stop spending. 

You need to set the standards & expectation in terms of labour, split the emotional labour evenly, have a calendar & a list on the fridge of daily chores & whatever. 

I wouldn’t say you’re enabling her but her shopping addiction is propped up by the safety net that you will help her out financially once she’s burned through her own money. 

She needs to make an active effort to change or you need to walk away because this relationship is depleting you emotionally & financially, which is impacting your life in a negative way. [Practical Advice]"
"I’m 33, My wife of 12 years recently decided we should split up, I have a 5 year old son who I share custody with and I have had a vacectomy as I don’t want any more children.
I have never dated anyone all throughout my 20s other than my ex wife.
I’m not really sure how to proceed as I don’t rate my chances and to be honest I’m scared
Any advice? Disclaimer, I'm a bit younger than you are, but I think the advice still holds. The worst thing anyone can do when it comes to dating is self eliminate. I get that you don't feel like you have reasons to be confident considering how long you've been away from the dating world. At the end of the day though, all that fundamentally matters is 1) having, knowing, and displaying your own value and 2) finding the right person for yourself. 

Everything else will fall into place. Put yourself out there, know your worth, and be confident in your worth. If you don't think you got this, then you don't. I'm not saying to blow smoke up your own ass either, but there's no need to give up before the battle begins. [Emotional Support]"
"hello friends,

when i was a junior in college i befriended this freshman. we were very platonic, just got lunch and chatted semi frequently. now, i have graduated and im 22. this summer we are hanging out a bunch, and we went to an 18+ emo club / party and ended up holding hands and being very intimate. i confessed to that i was developing feelings for her and she said she felt the same way too. i feel conflicted about continuing, considering that i am in soon going to be a salaried public school teacher in less than a year (have to get my student teaching done first) and she will still be in college and figuring her life out. 

it should also be noted that she has been in many relationships before and just got out a really abusive one a couple months ago. i, have never been in a relationship and feel comparatively immature for my age. at the same time, i wonder if i am selling myself short / holding myself back from growth. i have often felt like i wanted more time to figure things out in college, but i didn’t expect this to happen!

EDIT: also, we live relatively near each other this summer, but when she goes back to college she will be 90 minutes away. 20 and 22 is no problem at all. A typical age range to be in when in a relationship. You just need to make your different lifestyles work when you'll be having a regular job and she is still studying. But that shouldn't be a big issue, people make it work all the time. It's a super common scenario. Good luck, OP. There is no need to hold back on this relationship if you like each other. :) [Emotional Support]"
"Been with BF for year and a half now. 

BF’s younger cousin came over during the weekend for a visit. They haven’t seen each other for quite a while.  Generally had a good time, but I noticed tiny moments where he ‘kinda’ left me out especially when the three of us are walking together. He would walk and speak to her and I would try and keep up with the pace but generally stays out of the conversation. 

When it’s time for her to head back, we walked her to the station. Halfway through the journey I had to slow down my pace cause I’m tired, they keep walking ahead and not once my BF looked back to check whether I’m keeping up with them or not. 

I kept to my slow pace but I can’t stop thinking about how if I just stopped walking my BF probably wouldn’t notice at all until his cousin point it out. Tbf we’re in a bit of a rush, but we did arrive 10mins early.

This happened once too when his parents came for a visit and he just walked ahead of his parents and leave me walking behind his parents. His parents took better care of me by not having me walked alone behind them.

To be clear I do not place any blame on his cousin at all, she’s super lovely and I’m really glad she came over. But her visit does make these moments stand out and starting to make me question my relationship with BF. 

When it’s just the two of us he doesn’t do that at all. It’s just when his family is around, even then it’s not often.

I just feel so hurt when I’m made aware of these little things, that I questioned whether he cares if I’m around or not, whether he even considers me as his GF, or even if he loves me,  and I want to communicate this to BF but doesn’t want to make a fight out of it. 

Any advice on how to do that? 
 Communicate. It is better to have a small argument than to let it fester. My first relationship died because of communication issues. [Practical Advice]"

I’ve been in a relationship for about 4 years now with an amazing girl! Truly is my best friend. The most loyal and caring human being towards me! Only thing is I don’t have that spark for her and I never really did. I know she is head over heels for me and honestly that’s why I have been with her for so long. We now own property together and our lives are twisted together. 

I was out of town this weekend on a business trip and I met this woman at a bar and when I tell you I didn’t know what hit me when i saw her. We talked and the chemistry and spark was instant. I felt bad for leading her on and eventually told her I had a fiancé. She seemed very bummed but we kept in contact for the next few days. I truly believe I may have met my soulmate. I mean I was left gasping for air when she would turn away. I have never felt that level of attraction in my life. 

I now am contemplating leaving my fiancé but I don’t seem how I can come out of that ok. I love her family and she loves mine. We have already started to building a life together and idk how I can justify throwing all that away for a woman I barely know. 

I am on here to seek advice and learn from others stories if they have been in a situation similar to mine. 


 You're treading dangerous waters, bud.  Everyone is nice when they're single and looking.  I'd really hate to see you unbuild your life with someone you were going to marry, pursue this other woman and find out she's actually not compatible once your new relationship rolls along.

"I was at a wedding this weekend, and while there were some things that went well ( got to dance with a girl and got her number at the end of the night) I did some very awkward things looking back on it and probably ruined my chances. Every time I have some sort of social interaction that isn’t normal or expected, I look back on it and cringe bc I do something weird or awkward like putting my name in her phone as A-a-Ron instead of being normal and putting Aaron, or leaning into a picture that someone was taking that in hindsight I don’t think I was meant to be part of, and probably other things like that. I can usually get a date or a number on occasion, but I tank my chances once people talk to me or text me or interact with me for a long enough time period. I’m tired of giving myself second hand embarrassment from doing cringe stuff, what can I do to help this? It makes me not want to do anything social because I’m tired of embarrassing myself  I think experiencing this is just a part of growing up. I know i went through something similar. 


You just have to take that experience and deny some impulses that pop up. [Commentator's opinion]"

I'm actually a really good guy and am so inlove with her I'll never unstand this, but she did all this so she can feel like running to another man 9 months pregnant is justified.

Why is there such evil in this world. I'll never understand how some1 could do such a horrid thing to some1 that has only ever wanted 1 thing and that was to lover and have a nice family for out daughters.

"Posted before. Struck up what I thought was an amazing friendship with someone. 3 weeks we talked so much shared so much and then out of nowhere ghosted. No indication anything was wrong. Felt like we had a connection where at least if either of us were no longer interested in talking there was enough connection respect and caring there to at least say hey this isn't working or something. 

Completely blocked. Defriended. Not a single word.  

So yeah I guess I was a fool. Thanks for reading. If you have advice please share it. Pretty sure I can't feel much lower or dumber or betrayed than I do right now. You probably didn't do anything wrong. Without communication you don't know if perhaps she was already in a relationship, wasn't ready for one, was afraid of her own feelings, etc. etc. etc.

Ghosting is somewhat common. You are correct that it would have been more respectful to voice it isn't working. You definitely can do that yourself as a person. That she didn't speaks to how you perhaps are different and is an example of incompatible values.

Which brings me to my point, that you ended up not being compatible. It really sucks. You aren't a fool though, this situation happens quite often. Sounds like you are ready for when you meet your special person! [Commentator's opinion]"
"I'm going through a shitty breakup and needing advice about the lessons that I should have learned or what I could have done better. Our main problems were poor communication, unresolved depression/sleeping/mental health issues of one partner, empathy burnout, dishonesty (but eventual honesty), and lack of/respect for boundaries with each other and with platonic friends. Our strong relationship qualities were VERY strong-great sense of humor/banter, share similar interests/hobbies, same tastes in food, film, books, etc, BEST SEX OF MY WHOLE LIFE, same principles/value, and a deep, deep love and care for one another.   
First big problem-our communication got really bad -just yelling and finger pointing with no actual problem solving. He (30 M) screaming and cursing me in public and me (34 F) finally losing my temper to the point I threw a giant cup at him. I'm enrolled in weekly DBT class after this incident and he moved out of the house.   
The next issue was my partner's ongoing depression, anxiety, weight gain, and sleeping issues going unresolved for two years, and getting worse once he began night shift. I tried at the beginning to help as best I good, which caused me to get empathy burnout and start to turn cold/disinterested when he would express his problems or I would start to nag him. As he does not take criticism very well and I do not handle empathy burnout well, it was a bad dynamic leading to several breaking -up-and-getting back together death cycles.  
The next problem was dishonesty. On one of our breaks, I slept with my friend and lied about it (that ""friend"" told me I should lie because it would cause a rift in the friends group-whole 'nother story right there). I lied at first then could not take it anymore and came clean that I slept with my friend while we were broken up. My partner lied about getting escorts twice during each of our major breaks-he eventually came clean as well. He had also gotten escorts before dating me, but did not tell me this when we began dating. I still am not over the hurt caused by him getting escorts and he still is SO ANGRY and not over that I slept with my friend.   
Good parts-I love him very very dearly and sincerely wished this was the ""love to end all loves"". I could see my self growing old with him, with both of us hunkering down and doing the therapy-but we never got that far. What could I have done differently? What can I do differently next time? This was such a heartbreak and I feel like maybe if we had really gotten to know each other first before moving so quickly, we could have sorted out some of these red flags? What are other successful couples' secrets to success? What can you do differently next time? Don't sleep with your friend and then lie about it, for starters. Everything else between you two could have been overcome at some point, but sleeping with the friend and lying about it was pretty much the death knell for any chance you may have had. p [Commentator's opinion]"

"I 28F have been seeing this guy 35M for about two and half months. We had great chemistry from date one, and have maintained consistent communication and time together though we both have jobs that require travel and long hours some days - we’ve made it work nonetheless. We’ve done no sleepovers or anything significant, however recently he’s started sharing more about his child (which I knew about from day 1). I’ve never dated someone with a kid, however I knew it was significant for him to start sharing and he even said it was. He’s also told me on his own volition that he really likes me and wants to be more intentional about us and our time together. I asked if that came with exclusivity as we have been intimate and I personally have not sought others and wanted to make sure we were on the same page. He agreed he too was not interested in others but the rest of his message really bummed me out. He basically said it was just me and his kid in his life right now but that he ultimately doesn’t know what he he wants and if he wants anything at all and that he’s just playing things by ear….. i didn’t make a fuss of things but I was genuinely confused. He said that he only as that I let him know if I start hooking up with and seeing someone else. Am I crazy or is that mixed signals? I feel like it’s a bit unfair to say we’re exclusive but that he wasn’t sure if it was moving anywhere… I stated early on that I ultimately was looking for a LTR. But I currently feel like I’m in some sort of relationship limbo and could be missing out on someone who isn’t confused or unsure about where we stand. Is that asking for too much after almost 3 months of getting to know someone? 
 Nobody can set your boundaries, but you. I would at least have the conversation with him that you are seeing his indecision as stagnation, and that for you, it is a deal breaker. 
If you feel differently than this, then explain it. Wouldn't spending almost 3 months warrant an honest conversation about limitations? [Commentator's opinion]"
"So we became a thing when I was 16 and she was 30. I believe I was groomed but at the time I didn’t realize it that I was being used. People warned me but I didn’t want to believe it. 

A few years later I realized how fucked up my life is.

I graduated high school early for her, lost friends and didn’t keep in touch with anyone. Dropped out of college for an online school that I rushed through just so I could be with her. She was “aging and needed to get married soon or she’d have to leave me” which I guess she tried.  

Now I have a degree that’s practically meaningless. Never got the college experience, in debt from spending money on trips, no social life or friends and I have trouble interacting with people, socially awkward. 

Now she’s saying she’s proud of where I am and how I am focusing on myself. I believe she has no right to say that to me when she ruined and took years of my life that were or should have been the most important.

Now she can’t do anything to help me or make things better but she sure can help me financially. Is it wrong for me to ask her for a couple grand? 

Like I know the better thing would be to move on but I find it soo disheartening and infuriating that she can easily say I’m proud of you and move on. While her life was never impacted this significantly compared to mine. 

What should I do? I told her tonight I find it difficult to hear or accept that from her. When in actuality it’s her fault. The challenges I face daily, parts of my life I never to go experience and make memories of.
 
She goes I guess it’s best to cut contact as she’s moved on and realized choices were made on both ends. That she doesn’t appreciate the victim game.

"My bf and I have been dating for a couple years. He tried to date a girl beforehand who wasn’t sexually compatible so they decided to be platonic friends. I find out that he drove her down the road to see the eclipse together, then they went to his house and laid on the trampoline with pillows and blankets (opposite end of the trampoline, my boyfriend said) talking and looking up at the stars. This girl did not know I even existed though. We met - I think because we had to because our paths were going to emerge - and she casually mentioned the hangout. 


My boyfriend said they were just hanging out as friends, and she was going through a rough time so he was there for her. And they went on the trampoline because he didn’t have chairs outside, and put down blankets because the trampoline was dirty. And he asked me then if he was allowed to have female friends on the trampoline.

He doesn’t really like me bringing it up (I’ve brought it up 2 or 3 times), says that I overthink, and that we talked about it once and that should be good.  Opposite ends even tho she didn’t know u exist (yeah right) [Commentator's opinion]"
"My boyfriend and I have been together a little over 3 years. There has been plenty of ups and downs, as any relationship entails. While I came name off a number of things he's done wrong, I don't think it has much to do with why I want to leave. I see things a lot differently than he does, and he is going to think I am running away. I believe I am trying to run towards something new and life-changing. It's been on my mind for months now, and I even have all initial and monthly costs planned out. 

I cannot keep repeating this cycle I am currently in. I know I will be unhappy if I continue. I just don't know how much longer I should wait. I also have obligations here, should that stop me? 

I am grateful for everything he has done, but I don't think I am satisfied here. Everyday is the same. I always have a feeling in my gut telling me to leave. He doesn't want to change, he wants to keep me by his side forever. I know for a fact he feels this way because of all the sobbing and pain about me leaving him. I think this is also my fault, as I comfort him in my arms, lying to him. I don't know what is keeping us together anymore, because I have started to detach myself more and more. We have talked about this multiple times, his or my behavior and how it can change. But I am no longer interested in trying to change him, I can only change myself.

I have meditated and weighed out the options for hours on end, but I'm still stuck. There are other factors that bring me to these conclusions, not just my boyfriend. I'm trying to be as logical as I can before I make such an impulsive decision.

First, I have a cat. I love her to death and I'm not sure I could take her because I plan to live out my car. Second, my car is not the best. It needs a lot of work because it is older. Third, I am legally obligated as a bond co-signer to monitor my boyfriend (a crazy story lmao). Last, I'm not sure he would survive on his own. What would any of you do in this situation? Is it time for me to embark on this journey or should I wait longer until I am fully prepared? I should also note that I have a reliable amount of income working from home.  wait so why not just take him with you? did i miss something in the post maybe? [Not Relevant]"
"Basically there's a newer coworker at the reception who's very shy and reserved. Barely says anything to anyone, no eye contact whatsoever. She won't even say hello unless you say it first. That type of thing.

I had a basic conversation with her but it wasn't really going anywhere ( could be that she's at work or not comfortable talking at work ). I left her to her own devices since I'm not really getting the vibe that she's interested at all. I'm not a pushy person.

Is it ill advised to just rip off the bandage and ask her if she wants to grab a coffee sometime and if it's a no, just respectfully say "" No hard feelings, totally understand "" and remain polite and professional from that point onwards or should I not even bother?

My boyfriend cheated on me, and after that, our relationship was never the same. I discovered that he was seeing another girl and talking to three more on Tinder. He had been using Tinder for three months while he was with me. I decided to forgive him. After he cheated on me, he constantly accused me of being unfaithful, controlled me, and asked me to send pictures. I agreed, but the problem was that he didn’t reciprocate. On Thursday, I found him walking with a girl; I knew she was his friend, but I still got angry and didn't text him all night because he didn't tell me he was going to do that, and he always demanded that I do those things. After that, he stopped talking to me for two days, until today when he decided to break up with me. His reasons: because I’m insecure, controlling, and jealous. I want to add that he invited me to lunch today and brought his mom. I couldn’t talk to him about anything except when his mom got up to order food. At that moment, he said, “We have nothing more to talk about. We’re done.” I feel somewhat frustrated by everything, and I feel it’s my fault for being jealous on Thursday and that nothing is right. Is this my fault? Because I think I am guilty.

I want to add that this is very painful for me, but the relationship was suffocating me financially. He was very demanding with gifts and food, liked to eat at expensive places, and I usually treated him, spending all my money on him every month. That suffocated me a lot, and I accepted the breakup just because of that. Financially, he left me in a very bad place. Do you think I should write to him and ask to fix things? What should I do? I don’t know what to do from now on. The relationship is done.  He was unhappy that you didn’t trust him (for good reason) and that you weren’t ‘letting him’ do what he wanted with whoever he wanted.

The dude was (is) a disrespectful, dishonest, disloyal cheating asshole.  People like that aren’t good people with high moral character.  When someone shows you who they are, *believe them.*

Surround yourself with friends, family, hobbies, sports, etc.  Save money while you’re at it.

It hurts when you find out that someone you care about isn’t who you thought they were / wanted them to be.  Onward to bigger and brighter things! [Practical Advice]"

It felt like we should discuss what happens next after his confession. Am I expecting too much, which is why I'm disappointed?

I am in a long-distance relationship. We are very much in love with each other. She has a very high sex drive so we sext often, which I love to do. We have a great relationship outside one thing: she has a pretty massive kink for NTR or “cuckolding”.

She brought it up several times and wants to involve me in it. Basically, it’s been a long time since she’s been intimate with someone and yearns for it. She’s been wanting to hook up with a guy, just once, and text me during. She is fine with almost any condition I set for it. She doesn’t want any kissing during, he will be blindfolded, etc.

I have some relationship experience but none were with this high sex-drive nor with such a kink. I can tell it means a lot to her but she told me she would never do it if it makes me sad.

I’d rather not do it at all, personally. I know no feelings are involved so it’s less jealousy, but I don’t want her to unconsciously compare my performance to some other guy. But I know this will mean she’ll just be pent up, especially given our current distance. She assured me it would be a one time thing and I’d be very involved.

I think, if I can set some conditions down, I might be willing to do it *just once*. I’d especially rather agree to it because, shitty as I am to think that, her hypersexuality is to the point where she’d either be miserable, or she’d go ahead and do it quietly. I’d rather at least be *involved* if she does.

I wanted to ask this for experienced kinky people: if you had such a kink, would you be satisfied with just one time? Did you ever end up comparing your partner’s performance to whoever you indulged in this cuckold kink with? How did it affect your relationship? There’s a close to zero chance it will only be once, lol. If you research cuckolding, it’s usually the man who has that kink, not the woman (seeing his partner with someone else, humiliation, etc). I think she’s just horny & wants your permission to fuck.

If you’re uncomfortable, say no. Maybe suggest an open relationship while you’re apart, so you can both get some? [Commentator's opinion]"

"I’ll preface by saying I understand everyone is looking for something different. I’m also not saying I don’t know what I’m looking for. I just don’t know how to phrase it in a way that is clear. 

-I’m definitely not looking for a hookup. 
-I’m not necessarily dating to marry, as in, I’m not in any hurry. I feel like any version of “I’m looking for something serious” is way too much pressure. I would be open to something serious with the right person. 
-It would be nice to go on dates and get to know someone if I find anyone that seems interesting and compatible. That is casual to me. If something serious develops from that, awesome! If not, maybe we can be friends or just go our separate ways, but hookups or fwb or situationships are still fully off the table. 

I feel like, to me, my intention is to date casually and see where that goes. But, to most men (at least most men on dating apps), something casual is synonymous with hookups. I’m not gonna have sex with someone I’m not dating. 

I don’t know how to make sure expectations are clear for everyone.  You can say something like, ""I'm open to meeting new people and seeing where things go naturally. I'm looking for genuine connections and enjoying the dating process, with the possibility of something serious if it feels right."" This communicates your openness to both casual dating and potentially something more serious without applying pressure or implying you're seeking a hookup. [Practical Advice]"
"I don’t even know where to begin with this but I’ll try to be as short as possible with giving the full story. 

I’m 26 and my girlfriend is 24. We’ve been together for a little over two years. Living together for a year. 
We have a very active sex life, usually every day or every other day.  She was my first. I wasn’t her first but that’s ok. So it’s safe to say I watched a lot of porn before I got into a relationship. 

We talked about it in the beginning of our relationship. She didn’t seem to have an issue. She watches it too. She just said no onlyfans because her ex cheated on her with an only fan model. I said ok. And we went about our relationship. Until we decided to watch porn together as a couple. At first she seemed fine, then she just walked away and said she wasn’t into it. 

She told me she saw the look on my face, and she doesn’t like that. And I guess ever since we moved in together, she stopped watching porn. She told me “I’m satisfied with you. I don’t need to watch it. It doesn’t do it for me anymore” 
I said I don’t watch it as often anymore either. And that was that. 

We started getting into dirty conversation, and once again. Porn came up. I mentioned that I look up instagram girls OF usernames so I can watch it on Reddit or another platform. I’m not paying. I’m not interacting. So I thought it was ok. 

I asked last week if she wanted to find a “JOI video for couples” (for those who don’t know, it’s a video of a woman instructing somebody how to pleasure themselves. It’s been something I’ve always liked. And she’s bisexual. 

She said “no” and said she wasn’t in the mood anymore. I said “even if it was a hot older woman???” She said no again and walked away. We talked after she she said that she doesn’t like how specific I am with my porn. As in looking up nudes of specific actresses and such. And that it makes her feel like she’s not enough when we have adventurous sex. 

I watch it wayyyy less than before. I just brought it up again months and months after because my girlfriend mentioned JOI. Her telling me what to do in person. That’s why I suggested one we could both watch. I don’t look up specific porn stars anymore and I don’t understand how it’s different than watching porn. It’s all just out of curiosity. 

Now she’s debating everything.  Porn in relationships is kind of a tricky topic. The sort of stuff your partner watches can bring up insecurities in you that you had no idea existed, or even actually give you new ones, it's pretty crazy.

When it comes to the OF thing, it's kind of obvious that it's not gonna be a good idea to look up OF girls even if you don't pay for it so 

No idea what kind of porn she's watching herself but my guess is that she compares herself to the women you get off to and feels threatened by them [Commentator's opinion]"

"Not sure if this is the right sub but it deals with “dating” so here I go.

I(30f) have been friends with Sam(35m) for 3 years, we recently stepped in the next stage of “talking”. He is very sweet,but one thing I cannot get over is his lack of financial planning.

Sam lives in the country and rent is no more than $550-$600 with utilities/car insurance included he pays no more than $900 a month. I live in the city and pay 2x that amount. I make good money but I am also very cheap and know how to save/spend. Sam eats out EVRYDAY. I have talked to him about his spending habits, eating at home VS eating out everyday. It’s gets nowhere

Recently I just got the ICK when he asked me for $3 and said he will pay me back. We got into an argument because of this like come tf on bro. Few days go by and TODAY he asks if I could buy him groceries for him and his daughter. Like $40 worth. 

Would I be wrong to buy them and then block him?

Ps he makes decent money to live where he is at. He could be saving $500-700 a month but as I stated very bad with money.  Acts of kindness getting abused. They will learn the hard way and hopefully try to save some money. If they ask for money and i do help. Its a one and done deal. [Commentator's opinion]"

It was hard on us but I was getting better and I thought we could fall back in love but by then he was gone. 

I’ve forgiven him but this hurts worse than cheating. I got angry bc our son called him and the mistress was making noises when she heard my voice that it seemed disrespectful and just. I blew up his phone after and he blocked me but it’s been weeks and he will change his work schedule and his or my mom tells me. WHY!?

I didn’t do anything to him and I’m doing so well, nearly back to normal. My neurologist said the case baffled him and I even started my own marketing agency recently and… the guy had not once asked how I am. 

When I blow up I get real nasty. I know. I’m so hurt and I don’t want him as a husband (ew gross)) but I do want to coparent well for our son and it’s impossible if he is so nasty/acts like I don’t exist. When I found out I kicked him out hurt he came over all the time bc it was good for our son and honestly I was okay bc by the time I found out I felt relief. I realized he had been really horrible to me but I was so sick/tired I didn’t react. I trusted him more the myself so I just internalized everything. For 8 years he was seemingly the sweetest man. He can this be the same guy? 

Someone make it make sense!

"I've been dating a guy for 6 months. His birthday was last month and I spent almost $200 on gifts that would be personal to him. My birthday was last week. He wished me a happy birthday via text and that was it. He told me he got me a ""small gift"" but never gave it to me after seeing him 3 times since. 
I got really emotional over the week and told him I didn't think we should be together. He didn't seem to care. 


My friends were furious when they heard he got me nothing, as they know I was making the effort to buy him his gifts online and to make sure I got it in time for his birthday. 

Was I expecting too much? I told him I would have appreciated even a rock by the river.  Sounds like one of you was in the relationship the entire time while the other wasn't. [Commentator's opinion]"
"You guys were absolutely right I should not have touched him when he asked me to stop. I really think I made this situation way worse.

Relevant information I forgot to include in my panicked state: we are both people who have been sexual assaulted multiple times and have PTSD from it.

I think if this was flipped and he kept touching me as someone who had been SAed and I choked him, no one would have batted an eye. 

Additionally, in the last few days he has set up an appointment to get medication, he had his first session with a therapist, and got diagnosed with Autism. 

This makes a lot of sense. I think he was having an autistic meltdown and then I triggered his PTSD on top of that. It still obviously doesn't make his reaction okay, but it makes it explainable.

We are taking some time separate to work on ourselves and our own mental health. We have had some really productive conversations. 

I am definitely going to keep my hands to myself going forward because I escalated this situation.

We've agreed that if anything like this were to ever happen again, that's a hard line for both of us and I'm moving out immediately.

I also tested him twice which maybe isn't the best thing, but I wanted to gauge his reaction for my own safety. I asked him if he'd go to anger management classes and he said if I thought it would help that he absolutely would. 

I also acted as if I had finally decided to move out, and he calmly accepted that and asked if he could help me out.

Ultimately I know the statistics. However I really think this was a case of some serious undiagnosed and untreated mental health. I'm going to give it another go and check in regularly with the people around me. He has also shared what happened with family and is being honest about the situation. …good luck. Be safe. If choking or any other act of violence happens even one more time don’t make excuses and rationalize it. The relationship needs to be over. [Practical Advice]"
"So recently I broke up with my boyfriend who I had been with for 3 months because I felt like he just didn't respect me. He would tell me dirty jokes and wouldn't stop when I told him it bothered me. Generally, he always tried to blame me whenever I tried to communicate with him about what I didn't like in our relationship. I also feel like he just didn't make an effort because he knew I'd never had a boyfriend before, so he thought anything would satisfy me. When I was breaking up with him, I told him that I was going through a rough time and needed to focus on myself, mentioning his behavior as well, and he didn't even ask what was going on.

Now, 2 weeks after we broke up, he wants to try again, but the first thing he writes to me is that ""he saw on my Instagram stories that I'm having fun with my friend."" I told him that we can keep in touch, but I don't think there will be anything more to it. He keeps saying that we should try but I'm not having any of it. The problem is that I have low self-esteem and I feel like that's why he treats me this way...

I wish that everything could be good in our relationship but I just feel that he is not the person for me and that nothing will come of it, but I also don't want to write anyone off 100% and I really don't know what to do.

TDLR, I broke up with my boyfriend but he wants me back and I don't know if I should give him a chance. He saw you having fun and is trying to worm his way back in. Don't do it. [Practical Advice]"
"Hello! Maybe a bit of an oddball question but hopefully I can find some interesting answers here.

I find that on dating apps there are a lot of women with prompts such as: Looking for a man with masculine energy, We’ll get along if you take the initiative, and other different ways of expressing a grievance of the fact that they experience men these days aren’t exhibiting traits conforming to stereotypical gender roles.

I find it quite unattractive, and also I really don’t want to waste my time with these people, especially because I don’t really feel I identify with the stereotypical gender role of a man. I’m a bit careful and sensitive. I don’t like sports. I'm not a macho guy basically. I can take the initiative to a certain degree but it doesn’t sit right with me if I’m the only one expected to do it.

Great, then I simply don’t need to write to these people you may say. I don’t! That’s not the problem, I feel as if there’s a lot of people sharing these sentiments despite not having a prompt giving it away. So I was wondering if there’s any prompt or something else that I might add to my profile to scare away people that are only looking for men who fit into the stereotypical male role without also making myself sounding as if I’m making a big fuzz about it. I want to have positive prompts that don’t make me seem uptight or negative. I find that it would be hard to convey what I want without it seeming a bit prude?

Hope I'm making sense, advice would be great!

TLDR: Want to convey in my dating profile that I don't conform to stereotypical gender roles without sounding like a prude. I know that dating apps are what people use these days to find prospective partners but the odds of someone being honest and the fact that one cannot represent themselves as others might see them makes things even harder.  The fake, touched up pics, the false narratives of who they think they are, or who they want to be, or who they want you to think they are is just mind boggling when it comes to weeding out the duds.  Then the interview dates that follow, it all seems to be so much trouble when all you really have to do is go out into the world and interact with other people to meet people.  The grocery store and laundry mats are great places to meet people.  It is a relaxed environment which leads to chance meetings.  Ask someone a question if they have tried xyz and did they enjoy it, how to cook it, etc.  Frequent the same cafe and check out others that frequent that same cafe.  You will spend much less time digging through endless profiles and see people in real life.  Volunteer somewhere, nice loving caring people do volunteer work and usually have better acceptance levels.  Good luck! [Commentator's opinion]"
"I’ve been texting with this guy for about a month and a half, we hung out once after a couple weeks of talking and I had a great time and he said that he did too. After that I went out of town for a little over a week and we agreed to hang out again after I got back. However, for the last week or so he’s been taking longer and longer to reply to my messages. A few days after I returned from my trip I asked him if he was free anytime soon so we could plan something and he said he would be busy for the next week but should be free after that and would let me know. It’s coming up to the time that he’s supposed to be free and he’s made no mentions of making plans since then, I’ve been back for almost 2 weeks now. He has told me that he has a lot going on right now (he’s taking a lot of summer classes, is working, has some drama going on in his friend group and also some family issues that may cause him to have to move out soon) so I know that he’s currently struggling a little bit. There have been a few times when he’s taken a long time to respond that he apologized and said it was because he had a bad day due to everything going on. He’s never taken more than a full day to respond before, however as of right now it’s been almost 30 hours with no reply and (I know this might be a little crazy of me) I checked his snap score and saw that he’s been active on there. I know that he has a lot on his plate but now I’m starting to have doubts that he’s just using that as an excuse to distance himself. I’m worried that I may be overreacting since we haven’t been talking for very long, but I’m considering ending things the next time he texts me (if he ever does). I feel bad because of everything he’s dealing with right now, but it just doesn’t seem like he’s in a place currently to be talking to anybody and I would rather not waste either of our time. I don’t necessarily want to end things, he seems like a good guy, but again I just don’t know if he’s in the right position for anything romantic. I want to give him some grace because of his situation but am becoming more and more suspicious that that’s not the actual reason for the long response times.
tl;dr: Been texting this guy for a month and a half, hung out once and both said we had a great time. Said we would hang out again but he hasn’t made any effort to and is taking a long time to reply so I’m thinking of ending it. Respectfully I think he is giving you every sign to move on. Even if he is being genuine, would you want this to be the typical cadence? You deserve someone who wants you and is on the same page. If nothing else stop talking to him first and see how he reacts.

"Hello everyone. Hope you're all doing well. Just came seeking some advice. 

My girlfriend and I have been together for a little over two months, however, we've known each other for longer (we've spoken for over a year).

When we got together, I experienced a lot of anxiety, which I suspect to be ROCD (a form of OCD focused on relationships), but beyond that, everything has been perfect. 

She is everything I could've asked for in a partner, or at least I thought she was, until the other day. We were making out and she said, ""the thought of someone else doing this to you makes me want to stab them."" Previously, we had talked about me being a bit possessive, her claiming that she wasn't. So, given this, I asked: ""So you are a bit possessive, aren't you?"" Jokingly, of course. I can't remember exactly how it got to this point, but eventually, I asked: ""Could you see me with another girl?"" Everything is blurry beyond this moment. Somehow it led to her saying, ""I could see myself with another guy."" At first I didn't hear what she said, and then had to backtrack. She said it would be like a performance for me, and that all she wants it to make me happy/proud. In fact, her saying this did the exact opposite. Once she realized that, she began explaining that is was just a fantasy and that she might not even be interested in it at all. She began crying and saying that she never meant to hurt me and that she doesn't want to ruin our relationship, in which I assured her that everything was okay, but it's still at the forefront of my mind. 

She explained to me later that she is in fact monogamous and doesn't want anyone else, but I can't get the thought of my head. My ROCD doesn't help either, as it always ensures that I fixate on even the smallest things. I know she loves me, that's a fact. But now I'm questioning the credibility and longevity of our relationship. I just can't seem to let it go at the moment. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you. I’ve never heard of ROCD, but if you think you have it, get yourself a real diagnosis & treatment instead of just suspecting you have it & letting it drive your thoughts. 

The lead-up to what she said looks like dirty talk focused on fantasy. You started it by asking if she could see you with another girl. She then took the baton & ran with it. [Practical Advice]"
"I matched with a guy on tinder, and while my original intent was to have casual sex, I ultimately decided I want to meet up a few times before doing so. However, the man seems so obsessed with Sex. He wants me to dirty talk even though I stated that I’m uncomfortable with that. He was also disappointed over the fact that I changed my mind about jumping straight into sex. He kept asking if it’s something he did and insisted on being safe and good guy. I said it’s because we’re strangers and that it wasn’t anything he did. He kept asking the same questions over and over again and I just said “let’s just see how Wednesday goes” and left it as that and stopped responding to him. However, I am thinking about blocking him all together due to his reaction alone. I only matched with him 4 days ago and he is set on texting me every day all day since then. I feel like if he is this taken back by me setting my boundaries, what else would he be upset over? Am I in the wrong here??? This is not a man who is going to respect your boundaries.

"As the title suggests, I'm having trouble navigating these types of conversations about moving in with two female roommates: one is a loose friend of a friend, and the other is a personal friend. (I can't afford to live alone and to me, these two people seemed like the best fit for me.) For most of my life, I've had no trouble making opposite-gender friendships that are strictly platonic, but I acknowledge that perspective may not always be shared.

At the end of the day, I want to make my partner feel more secure about this situation. Has anyone had experience with this in the past, and how can I be simultaneously supportive and realistic of the situation at hand?  You said these women felt like the best fit for you. That’s telling. If it was me in your position, the best fit for me would be people that were the same sex because I know that would be best for my relationship and my relationship would be very important to me. Long distance is already SO hard, I would personally leave the relationship if my partner moved two women into his home. It wouldn’t be a concern of cheating it would just be that it would become too difficult to continue the relationship. It would also be clear to me that my partner wasn’t making decisions for us but for himself. [Commentator's opinion]"

"He wasn't like this in the beginning, but as we got closer, he got more comfortable. It hasn't even been two months since we met, and I already told him how hurtful it is to be left on read. He apologized and promised to be more considerate, but he always uses the excuse, ""I'm always so busy"" (he works in private equity investments).

He asked me out for brunch today, but I wasn't feeling well, so I apologized and offered to do dinner after work on Monday. He said he's busy and suggested we rain check for next Sunday because he's going out of town mid-week. After that, he left me on read again.

I don't know what to do with this guy. I like him, but I feel like I'm begging for attention. Should I move on or stick with the date and talk to him in person about this?

"I (20F) recently broke up with my boyfriend of 1 year (LDR) and three guys i knew IRL simultaneously entered my life. I have been sexually active with all three, ofc after letting them know I was. I’ve know them for a month, and guy #1 (23) wants to commit to monogamy since he realized he liked me too much to “keep it casual”, and I’m having a hard time deciding what i want. He feels uncomfortable that I’m meeting other people, and he said he wouldn’t be okay with seeing someone that didn’t choose him over seeing others. It’s understandable, but it puts me in a situation where I feel like i’m already prepping for a new relationship. On one hand, i’m newly single and seeing who I am most compatible with, but on the other, i do genuinely have a liking to him and he’s very caring. We had a deep conversation where i sobbed for 3 hours because I wasn’t sure what decision would be best for me. He’s everything that screams BF material, and i enjoy the time we have together. We’re also compatible, but i also have trauma with men becoming infatuated and then leaving. I also seem to be compatible with the other dudes I’m talking to, since all of them have told me that they’ve “never connected with someone like this before”. (You tend to hear that a lot as a woman.) I’m also very good friends with the other two guys i’m talking to, and i would also like the time to get to know them. I feel guilty and selfish for wanting to hang out with them more before committing. It also makes me sad that I won’t be able to be friends with them if I do commit, but I’m scared of losing guy #1. I'm genuinely so conflicted, and i dont know what i should do.

"So we’ve had arguments about this one girl in the past who he said was just a friend to him, and I never believed it because their exchanges seemed flirty. He had been liking her photos and what not and I actually just requested that he doesn’t keep contact with her if he’s had a flirtatious relationship in the past. He denied her even touching her, but I’ve heard from other people that they actually slept together. Anyways, he removed her from Instagram. 

Last night we were laying in bed having our own screen time, and our phones touched so his contact card shared and under his emergency contacts it had her listed as “girlfriend”. 

I honestly flipped out and I was telling him he lied to me about her, not having been his girlfriend and he was saying she was never his girlfriend, and he doesn’t know how that got there, to stop asking questions about the past blah blah. 

I never intended to ask questions about his past before me, but it’s a lie that bothered me. I’m not sure if she was his girlfriend or not (they worked together), but every sign points to that she was and he can’t admit.  

After this, he got up and went to the couch to sleep for the first time in her marriage and hasn’t talked to me all day today. Part of me feels immature for making an argument out of this, but honesty is so crucial to me that I’m having a hard time letting this white lie slip. 

What’s the most mature way that I can approach this? He seems to not want to communicate with me at all, and honestly seems quite disgusted that I reacted the way that I did.   Don’t get gaslit.

"Hi! So l've been dating this guy for about a year now. He's a great guy but l've recently found out some things about him that if I knew then, I probably wouldn't have pursued our relationship.

My biggest concern now is I found out that he's taking steroid injections (250g/week) on/off for about two years now and he gets his supply from his friend who ""knows a guy"".. so yeah, it's unprescribed. I’ve talked to him about this before and explained my concern but he said he is taking it with caution so no need to worry. Problem is I can’t help but worry knowing that he’s taking it illegally and for quite a long time now and it’s solely to gain muscle better (he's a gym rat).

"hi there, i recently reached back out to an ex that i cut off contact with two years ago. he did something that really upset me, and i decided to set the boundary and block him and i hadn’t spoken to him until last month in two years. it’s hard considering him an ex because we were pretty young and the bulk of our relationship was during peak covid times. I had only met him in person a handful of times. I was 17 when i stopped speaking to him and am 19 now. He also went away for college last year and is home for the summer, we hung out today and I kinda realized speaking and chatting with him has made me feel those past feelings again. He was the first person I ever loved and I do have a soft spot for him. I didn’t initiate anything today because I was fearing rejection lol. Any advice on how to go about telling him how I feel? The stakes aren’t super high because it’s not like he’s become a super close friend or anything and we weren’t talking at all until about a month ago. I don’t think i’d want to have a full blown relationship since he is far away for school, but I’d like to share with him at a prospect of something maybe happening. Feel free to share any advice on how I can communicate this to him. You say it isn't high stakes but I do think you have to be realistic about how intense your feelings may become given how quickly they came back and the reality it would be long distance. That can be a lot more tiring than you hope. 

To me the stakes rather than being low instead feel weighted towards a negative outcome. Like even best case scenario he reciprocates and you go long distance. Worst case you feel rejection, or maybe you do date and realise that actually it was mainly nostalgia informing your feelings to begin with. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I'm going to say the most cringe thing on planet earth, however, I'm working on being less socially awkward and there's this cute Walmart employee I would like to ask out.

2. I have a habit of being awkward and being far too intense.

I'm debating trying my luck and just going and asking, but I'm also very nervous.

He's just so cute and I get really excited and hyper. You are female and him male? Don't dox yourself but is 4 years older closer to them being 20 or them being 50?

i quit.

ive been single for about 4 years now. i have been actively going on dates and meeting new people for over a year now. no luck. men just aren’t looking for relationships. i know that im attractive, smart, funny, caring, etc. i am relationship material. i have a lot to offer: the men ive dated have acknowledged this but they are all emotionally unavailable. you may ask, “why date guys that are aren’t available?”. to that i say, “why are unavailable guys on dating apps in the first place?”. 

the dating market is abysmal. great women and men alike are all struggling and it’s no coincidence why. dating in 2024 is a lost cause.

im hoping that me giving up is liberating as i say goodbye to the never-ending disappointment of dead end connections and rejection. maybe now i’ll shave my head. move overseas. become a nomad. i dont know! and it doesnt matter now!

"my girlfriend and i (2 years together) were renting a house with roommates and we both have been unhappy with the living situation. so we planned to both move back in with our parents to save money to buy our own house. 

she already moved in with her mom for about a month and was able to get a job with her. there is a water leak so they have to keep the water cut off until they need it on. the electricity only works in one bedroom so they cannot run AC or the fridge or cook and when they need to use the water, there’s no hot water because the water heater can’t get power. (it is rural mississippi in the middle of summer) but she chose to move there.

i have a decent job and i move in with my dad tomorrow. my plan is to save up enough money to pay off debts and to buy a car for her with cash and for a down payment on a house i can own. i have been renting different houses for almost 4 years and i’m throwing money away

she wants me to just go rent another house so we can be together just us two. i told her i want to own my next home and she is saying i don’t care about her living situation. i’ve offered solutions like living with other people and for me to pay to have someone fix the issues with her mom’s trailer

she is genuinely mad at me for not getting her out of that trailer when i am trying to build a good future for us both. she threatened to kill herself to see if i would just go ahead and get us a place. i think the whole situation is crazy.

I may have told him that we should both see other people and see how it feels and that really hurt him because he felt like I was using him like a second option.

"This incident just happened and I feel like I’m losing my mind. My husband (28M) and I (27F) were having a conversation this morning about getting our house cleaned up and organized. He swears I didn’t say something to him but I know I definitely did. Neither of us were on our phones while this was happening. We were sitting on my ILs front porch drinking coffee. The conversation went something like this: 

Me: you know the accent wall in our kitchen that is a greenish color? 

Him: yeah 

Me: I want to get something like a hutch to put there so we can actually store things in drawers. I also want to get something with drawers to go in the living room. 

Him: yeah I think that would be good 

Then we moved on talking about other stuff. So about an hour ago we were talking to his parents about it and I mentioned it again and he had no clue what I was talking about. I went through the whole conversation again and he swears I didn’t say that. 

This happens once a week (or less) for us. It drives me insane. I know 100% I said what I did. He does have ADHD (I do too but I have inattentive ADHD) so I’m sure it’s something related to that. 

I’m really not mad about the fact that he didn’t hear me. I’m mad that he tells me I didn’t say something when I know for sure I did. Does anyone else have this problem? Should I just start recording our conversations so I can play it back for him later? Does anyone have any advice on how to fix this?  That is because men tune us out and just answer but did not hear what you said ! I never believed it either, but when I was working and had a lot going on around me I would answer someone and not remember lol

"I (F 22)have been with my partner (M 22)for almost 4 years now. Generally we are really happy and have overcome a lot of difficult barriers to get to where we are today. However we have recently realised that our life goals do not align with each other. 
My partner works really hard as he has to financially support his family (him being the main provider) which means he normally works all day. Because of this I only ever see him once a week and really also only call once or twice a week. While I would like more I've accepted that this is his schedule. He also always goes away on work trips for weeks on end which I've had to get used to. It's especially tough right now because I want a lot more out of the relationship than I get but I can understand that he needs to work this hard and he does have these great career opportunities that I would never want to hold him back on. 
But the main issue is that he wants to keep working this hard, even harder, partly to support his future and his family, but also partly because it's his career goal to become extremely successful with his own company and retire early when he can finally relax. As hard as it is not being with him much I want to support his career journey, but I also do feel like by the time we aim to get married, I want him to settle down, work more normal hours and just be able to actually spend evenings with him literally just doing things like cooking dinner together or having games nights. But with his career goals this is unlikely as he probably won't be able to reach this stage until mid/late 30s. I know that that is his dream, but I also don't want to be alone in the marriage. I know he says he'll try his best to give me time but realistically with what I'm experiencing now in the relationship I don't think is realistic.
I just wanted to write this to explain my thoughts and see if anyone who's gone through similar situations has any advice on what to do. I don't want to break up with him as he is a big part of my life but I worry I am going to end up resenting him by not prioritizing time with me. I can't tell if I need to let go more and be more supportive or if what I'm asking is reasonable. Sounds like you already know it’s over. You want different futures. [Commentator's opinion]"
"Context: Girlfriend and I are both attending the same school where we met at the start of last quarter. We have been together about 4 months. Over the summer, I left to go back home, and she stayed up at school, which is about 3 hours from me. Before I left, we agreed to stay exclusive to one and other, while also agreeing to visit one and other as often as possible. 


My (20M)Girlfriend (20F) called me yesterday and asked if we could go on a no-contact no-commitment break over the summer because she has too much going on with work and other personal things.  This seemed very out of the blue, and I wasn’t very interested in having much of a conversation about it because I was so caught off guard. I texted her afterwards apologizing for my lack of communication, and asked if we could have another conversation about it. I am fine with going on a break if that’s what she needs, but I am not okay with both of us seeing other people for two months, and then getting back together in the fall like it didn’t happen. 


Would it be unreasonable of me to request that we remain committed to eachother despite being on a break? 


Any other advice/opinions on the matter are also appreciated, i’m feeling a bit lost. I like this girl a lot, and I want this to last. 
 Bruh she wants to fuck other people let’s use some common sense. [Hurtful]"
"Hi,

My Girlfriend was just told by her friend’s boyfriend that he is proposing in a few weeks. We currently have a trip from Denver - Chicago (July 6th weekend, my family wedding) a trip from Denver - Philly (July 13th weekend, to visit GF friends) a trip from Denver - St Louis (July 27th, golf trip without her) and a trip from Denver - Vegas (August 3rd weekend, our friends Bday).

As you see the only weekend that is open for the next 5 weekends is now the weekend her friend is getting proposed to. I am friends with these two people but not nearly as close as my GF is. I feel like this is a situation where she should be going by herself as she wants to go & and I should not feel guilty for not going. She says “If it’s somewhere you would want me to go, I would go” and it makes me feel guilty. I feel like a bad BF if I do not go, but I truly do not want to with all these other weekends traveling. What is the healthy way to deal with this situation?

 The level of traveling you're planning already is going to be exhausting, and our bodies need rest. And if we don't give it to ourselves, it will force us to stop- by getting sick. If you don't want to go, it may be an indication that you need rest.

Maybe instead of saying you don't want to go, you could reframe it as you can't go because you already planned to rest and recover that weekend. [Practical Advice]"
"I have been with my boyfriend for a year. My father is a pastor and he can hear from God. When my dad first met my boyfriend, he said that God told him that I needed to leave him alone because he would be dangerous and hurt me. Although my boyfriend is much taller than me and bigger than me, he has NEVER shown any signs of being hurtful and has never put me in danger, much in fact that he is very hesitant about being physically close to me because of the fear of hurting me. My boyfriend has also been very supportive while I'm in school, offering to help me pay for books, getting me better food, and driving over three hours just to visit me on the weekends. I went to see my boyfriend yesterday and my father says that God will severely punish me for not listening.

I don't want to disobey God but my boyfriend is the total opposite of how my father describes him. I don't want to leave and hurt my boyfriend for this, as my boyfriend has had a not so good life and believes that God dislikes him. I am struggling with my head and my heart. I don't want to lose my boyfriend but I also don't want to disobey God longer. Part of me feels that God will bring my boyfriend back into my life if I let him go but I am not certain about it, which further scares me.

Any advice would help a lot. Thank you your father hears nothing at all. he just uses and abuses the name and word of God in order to control you. don't let him fool you. it is your decision which person you choose as boyfriend not his [Commentator's opinion]"
"I got out of a long term relationship with a highschool partner several months ago. I've been hitting it off with a guy I met on a dating app but I never know what to suggest for dates even though I really want to spend more time with him. My go to is usually billiards because I like to play a game while talking- it takes a lot of pressure off me. He's not a fan though. We've gone for food and for walks around the city or at parks. I want to change things up a bit though. I'm out of ideas because he's not super into ""slower"" game dates such as 2 player board/card games. The date idea does not need to involve a game though. i could only come up with game-like things: bowling, trivia/bingo, mini golf, escape room ?? [Practical Advice]"
"I (30F) have been on 2 dates with a guy (32M)  who has an eyebrow piercing. We met on a dating app & the piercing is not visible in any of the pics on his profile (it may be new).

I’m really not into piercings on men & do not match with guys who have them. When he showed up with one on our first date, I immediately thought this was a no but continued the date to not be rude. 

Anyways, we’ve really hit it off and have had 2 6+ hour dates. However, I still can’t see myself dating a guy with a piercing long term (every time I notice it I get an ick). 

Should I just cut things off now since it’s so early or should I continue & maybe ask if he’d be open to removing it if we ever get to the relationship phase? If I cut things off, do I mention the piercing as a reason? If I continue & then ask about him removing it as we start to get more serious, when is the right time to do that?

I’ve never asked a partner to change anything about their appearance and don’t really feel that it’s fair, but this feels more fixable than most things which is why I’m wondering if talking about it makes sense. 

TLDR: Newly dating a man with a piercing (dealbreaker for me). Break things off or ask if he’d be open to removing it?

Edit: Thank you all for the advice! I’ve decided to just break things off with him. I think you all are right that if I was super into him it wouldn’t be an issue. And he deserves someone who is super into him just the way he is Break it off because if a little piece of metal in his eyebrow bothers you that much then you don't like him. Don't waste his time [Practical Advice]"
"Anytime there's a minor inconvenience in his life, he tends to cope through food. It annoys me and it worries me. He has several lifestyle related health issues like diabetes, cholesterol and high BP. He usually binges on fried junk food. He also has a soft spot for rice and eats a lot of it. Most of his meals are very rice heavy which is not got for disbetes. 
We don't have healthy communication in the family. I believe he has several unresolved issues but he refuses to go for therapy. He generally gets very defensive when anyone points out any flaw of his. How can I bring up delicately and respectfully?  You don't need to bring it up. He should get medical and nutritional advice from his doctors. He is an adult and can make his own choices to follow that advice or not. [Practical Advice]"
"My bf and I have been together for almost a year. We’ve had our communication-spats, but we’ve been so into each other that we’ve worked through them. For the most part. 
We have one difference that honestly shouldn’t be that big of a deal, but it’s become one of our biggest hurdles. 
We don’t live together yet. And naturally a lot of sleepovers happen. 90% of the time it runs smoothly. The last 10% though…
I’m a bit of a rule-follower. I like structure. So when we agree to do sleepovers, I go very far to keep those plans intact. Because we made plans together. He, however, is a little more laid back. Those 10% of the time- he cancels. And I don’t mean a day or so in advance. He’ll sometimes cancel 20 minutes after we agreed to meet. He tries to make new plans immediately, but I get mad, of course.
I tried to talk to him about it, and said it made me super uncomfortable, that he couldn’t at least cancel some time ahead. It’s stressful and makes me feel insecure.
He says that usually it happens because he is way too tired and don’t want to disappoint me because he won’t be able to be that present in our time spend together. And that he values relations where we can say no, when one of us isn’t up for meeting.
It hurt me when he said it like that. Because of course I want him to be able to cancel if he’s not up for meeting. But I’m not okay with getting all excited to see him to then be disappointed at the last minute. 
With the way he said this, I’m not sure I’m being too demanding. Any one have any experience similar to this? Thanks in advance. Shit happens who cares if he cancels? Things come up, moods change, shit happens. U get mad? For canceling? Holy shit what a crazy overreaction. He's allowed to be tired. Honestly if my partner acted the way u did after I canceled cause I didn't feel up to it I'd break up with her. It hurt u that he expressed an opinion he had? Which is a very normal and healthy opinion. You should be able to cancel if ur not up for it. U 100% are being to demanding. [Commentator's opinion]"
"Sorry in advance if this is all over the place. Also when I mention summer its when school ended for my son. (If that makes sense lol) 

My husband and I have been married for 8 years. So I have been to quite a lot of his family events and his to mine. For the past 3 years in the summer,  because we live about 2 hours away from family.  I would take the children to his family events while he works as well as mine. I am also a stay at home mom , so regardless the children are always with me. 

This week I just took our children to his older sisters house for a pool party, and she invited us back for a 4th of July party. All of which my husband was working or will be working. Ive known his family for so long, if Im not tired I go because I enjoy hanging out with them too. 

This summer his youngest brother(29M) is having a birthday party along with his son(9m) and he invited us. I told him I am all partied out can he take the children this time by his self. 

His first response is to say, ""You see, this is why I don't invite you to go places with me. Whenever I want you to go to my family with me , its a no."" 

This summer alone, we have been to both his niece and nephew graduations together. I have been to two of his sisters pool parties and the summer just began. 

After arguing, I feel for no reason. The point he was trying to make is this brother that invited us usually doesn't throw parties and it could be a time for ""us"" to hang out. 

My point is , realistically he is going to leave us by going for a ""walk""(if you know you know) as he always do and I won't probably see him again until its time to clean up( because he loves to stay and clean). So the whole time I will have to keep an eye on my children and one of them is a toddler, so I will be with a child all night. 

Which brought me back to my first response of ""Can you take them instead?"".

I feel like he is trying to guilt trip me into going. Is there a reason you can't communicate your concerns?   You guys have been married 8 years. This is the sort of problem that is easily resolved by healthy communication and compromise.

He wants to go, you don't want to get stuck with the kids. Easy middle ground is to just go but he be in charge of the kids. [Commentator's opinion]"
"My partner was logged into his “work” instagram and got a message from a new coworker saying “hope to see you are the office”. He said the same back and then added “dig your vibe :)” and then deleted the entire conversation between the two of them. He does not delete other conversations. 

I am upset feeling like there were flirty undertones and ulterior motives and that he deleted the messages for a reason- because they weren’t appropriate. 

He claims he doesn’t have any interest and “thought she was a lesbian” so there was no issue with sending “dig your vibe :)” 

Is it overreacting to feel like this was dishonest and not trustworthy behavior, or was he being shady by being flirty and deleting it? 
 Yes, this is trust breaker. 

- He is willing to flirt with other people. 
- He is willing to lie to you.
- He is willing to say shift blame to you instead of taking accountability for being shady.
- He lacks accountability. [Commentator's opinion]"

"Is it a dick move? Did I do something here that stands out? I'm trying to let this guy know that yea, I am indeed upset and and he fucked up.

We go to the same gym, it's a 24/hour place but haven't ever crossed each other until now. Right before this just happened, we argued and officially broked it off by me telling him he's 1. On my shit list and 2. Fuck him.

I saw his truck in the parking lot when I was at the gym, so I put his stuffed animal he gave me (which just so happened to be in my car) on his truck bed. 

Would he care? Is this a shitty thing to do to someone? If I'm being fr, I don't want to break it off. I just wanted to be treated differently I guess. Idk 

I broke it off because I've been doing everything for him. I drive out to him (15-20 min drive) and always am paying, always going the 3xtra mile etc. Idc much about the money, but I make incomparably less than he does. But he does nothing for me, and doesn't realize this. I paid for a trip to Vegas (week) and pay for dinner etc etc. Truly, though, I don't care that much about the paying for things. It's that I'm not being used it what it feels like. We actually broke it off a while ago and we're in this weird friendship thing... but he continually asked for sex even though I told him no, and how it made me feel used. So yea I just told him to fuck off and gave his thing back. Idk what do yall think? if you want to get his attention and get back with him then yes giving him that gift back shows that he’s still on your mind. If you truly want things to end, cut all contact don’t show him an ounce of it and stop giving him his gifts back [Practical Advice]"
"I [38] have a female friend [36] who I've been developing feelings for the last few months. I seriously thought she was too, especially a few weeks ago when we were hanging out and she started being very physical affectionate in a way she hasn't ever been before - she sneaked up and kissed me on the cheek when we met, cuddled up very closely and intimately with me while we were laying in the park, held hands with me as we walked, and encouraged me to cuddle her some more when we stopped walking to admire a view.

I had thought that was going great, but then she very suddenly stopped and went cold,  and when I told her next day about my feelings she said she didn't feel the same. She said her affection was only platonic and she was irritated that I'd 'misinterpreted' it. I was pretty hurt and confused,  and said I wanted to talk more about where we stand going forward. She said she was stressed and needed a few days to process things. 

That was a month ago, and she's been silent since. We used to message multiple times every day, but she stopped completely, other than a brief spurt of messaging a couple weeks ago as if everything was normal, which stopped again as suddenly as it started.

I was planning on cutting her off completely,  but then all of a sudden, early this morning, she messaged again. She sent me a link to an upbeat song about love in one of her spotify playlists, saying it was to give me energy for the week.

Should I even bother responding? Should I mention the silence, or previous events? Really not sure what to do here. It is odd how she made it seem like it was something more than a platonic friendship. I myself am a very touchy person with my friends (who are comfortable with it and know me pretty well). I can relate to holding hands but I have never kissed my friends on the cheek nor have cuddled?? It's like she intentionally wanted you to have feelings for her and wanted to ""test the waters"" without needing an exact talk about it. And hypothetically made up in her mind that she wasn't feeling you. 

Honestly just my speculation on it, of course I could be totally wrong but that's just me. For what you should do, you could either not waste your time with this girl anymore or if you really want to find out more or have a sense of closure, be straight up and ask. If she completely ghosts it and never texts again, you have your answer. If she actually does respond, you'll see where that goes. [Commentator's opinion]"
"Hey everyone! I just recently joined dating apps and have talked to three guys seriously so far. The first two were nice and we went on dates and it was good but with the third guy we’ve only texted so far but it feels different somehow, like this is how it’s supposed to feel. We haven’t even been in our date yet (which is tomorrow) and I feel like I’m already head over heels. Is this a bad things? I’m not gonna tell him “I love you” super early or rush to make it official but I think we both fall quickly and fall hard so I’m worried for some reason? We’ve talked about it just a little and said that these feelings of attachment usually last beyond a “honeymoon” phase so I’m hoping that isn’t an issue but something still feels too good to be true. 
Is it bad we’re both so into each other already? We haven’t talked about anything crazy like marriage or kids but we’ve talked for hours every day and are pretty flirty (calling each orher cute, adorable, etc.) even though it’s only been a few days. Should I even be worried about this?
I’m hoping the date goes well tomorrow and that the chemistry over the phone translates in person. 
Is there anything I should watch out for or be cautious of?
Any thoughts are appreciated!!! Have a good time on your date. Sounds like you're excited, just remember to not let anything you don't want to happen too soon. [Emotional Support]"

"I’m (F19) dating (M24) he has this thing which I find very strange this is my first ever serious relationship he tends to be very rough in a playful way but when I do the same thing he tells me I’m aggressive if we’re watching a movie he goes on his phone is completely fine but if I do it an argument happens he opens the bathroom door without knocking he thinks it’s okay because we’re dating how do I fix this? You aren't going to like this answer.

  
You are a teenager dating an adult. There is a reason he isn't able to date people his own age.

  
When you are 24 you aren't likely to put up with the kind of shit he is putting you through. (see first point). It's best to learn the lesson now and not over commit. 

  
Everything he does is classic of a abusive manipulator. Things will only get worse from here.

"Okay, so I (27M) have a thing for my girlfriend's feet (27F). I mean, I just find them beautiful and interesting, but I feel ashamed of that because when we discussed some kinks, she told me that people who like feet gross her out . And I'm going to be honest, okay? I'm not a full-on feet guy; I just like hers, and I don't know why. I don't want to go into details.

Anyway, I've kept that inside myself for 6 whole years. By the way, everything is great here. We have a healthy relationship and a healthy sex life, but I feel an urge to tell her about my ""kink."" However, I'm still afraid (foolish, yes, after 6 years), and I don't know what to do, so I came here for advice.

What do you think I should do? How should I approach this...

Edit - also sorry for my english. Just tell her what you told us: You think she has beautiful feet and you're not going to worship them, to lick them or to use these as anal plugs :) (Or maybe only that she has beautiful feet and you didn't want to say that before because she thinks feet people are gross) [Practical Advice]"
"Me (23F) and my ex (32M) met on dating app. I've just got out of a 3-year relationship 3 months ago. Although I hate to admit, my initial intentions to download the dating app was to have some fun. Then I matched with this guy, which is my ex. He said that he wanted to date to marry. He seemed super sincere, after matching with me and asking for a chance to get to know each other, he removed all of the previous matches. He took me on our 1st date, he was humble, kind and truthful, the way he talk about himself, his family, and his career made me believe that he was the best green flag I had ever met. I was treated like a princess, and then he asked me to be his girlfriend. After the date, we got closer, we talked about daily life things and also mentioned about intimacy. On our 2nd date, we both agreed to have sex for the first time. Everything was great. From that day on, he did text me like usual, but the amount of messages decreased, he also complained with me that he had a lot of work to do (he is a civil engineer), it took him some hours to reply messages lol, sometimes even fell asleep while texting 😂 I realized that I had developed feelings for him, but couldn't get the same attention from him, I knew I messed it up this time 😂. I decided to stop this relationship before it's too late. I texted him to explain that I wanted to stop because the lack of time we had for each other, and he said that he was in shock, but still respect my opinion.
Have you ever been through the same situation? I want to hear from you. I’m an atheist, I believe in sex after marriage.

It’s not exactly his fault. Guys have less respect for you after you have sex. It happens all the time.

It sounds like you didn’t even talk to him or try to save the relationship before dumping him. I think this is, to say the least, irresponsible. How are you going to last in a marriage in the future, if you can’t bring these issues to him in the first place? Atleast brings these concerns to him before dumping him? Unless, of course, you didn’t want marriage. Then I’d question why you dated in the first place [Commentator's opinion]"
"I (25f) have been talking to this guy (27m) for a few weeks now and the situation is straight up something I can’t believe is happening to me.

We met on a dating app. When I first saw his profile, I was like this guy is a model it has to be someone catfishing with his pics. He’s as tall, dark, and handsome as it gets. I told myself what the hell and took the chance to match with him anyway. We end up on FaceTime and I’m like holyyy shiiii he’s real.

We keep talking and add each other on social media. He has thousands of followers. He’s a soon to be doctor, a former professional athlete, and has a ton of friends. I on the other hand have less than 200 followers, hardly post, and a very small social circle. He’s always out and I’m a homebody.

We’ve gone on a few dates now and he’s still showing so much interest. He’s been nothing but sweet, kind, and respectful. Always texting me, calling, planning dates, and respecting my boundaries around intimacy.

I really like his personality too. I thought I wouldn’t because I despise all social media and he has quite a social media image, but he’s so much more deep than what his pictures portray.

I never once mentioned this to him, but I have no idea why he’s supposedly so interested in me. I’m objectively not as attractive or social as him. I’d say I’m cute, have a pretty fit body, and also a doctor, but it’s nothing compared to the girls following him. I know people stare at us when we walk down the street together. They probably thinking wtf why is someone so hot with her???

I see myself sabotaging this in the future. I never once mentioned how I feel or ask why me. But it just feels too good to be true to me. Do I talk to him about the obvious? Maybe it's not as obvious as you think. Just roll with it.  He might be looking for something real.  He's probably got more to him than looks. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I came out of a LTR about 2-3 months ago and recently started dating again.

I met someone on Bumble and we went out on a date which turned into spending the day together. By the end of the day I'd seen some behaviors which I wouldn't want in a new LTR and so very transparently and nicely said I don't think I'd want a LTR however am happy to be friends / casually date.

We went out on a second date and I noticed her saying something like ""you won't find someone as cool as me or as fun as me / another me"" and recently she sent a meme to me which says ""Sorry for being so beautiful, fun and intelligent"" with like hearts and a unicorn in the background.

She's a bit eccentric which is cool but I'm really not sure what's going on with this theme of talking about herself and praising herself and I don't know what to say / do when she says / sends these things. It's a bit concerning.

Aside from this theme, she's pretty nice and cool to be around. And said on the first that that she would also like to keep things casual. That said, how do I navigate these kinds of messages? She seems to have taken your rejection as a challenge to change your mind. Everyone loves a good chase! [Commentator's opinion]"

"I (christian) have been in relationship for 26 months with my boyfriend (Muslim). The religion has not been a big problem for us until recently, during the past Ramadan my boyfriend complained of feeling lonely.

We would go to the mosque together for Taraweeh, but I would remain in the car because I am a christian. He said felt lonely and craved the companionship of praying together and being in unison with each other's beliefs.

He also said we should break up because I want to gain financial stability before settling down and he wants to settle down now, and we already decided that once settled down, we would take on traditional roles (stay at home wife, working husband) which I really don't have a problem with.

I have begged him so many times that we shoukd go ahead and be together because I feel like there's no compromise I wouldn't make to be with him but he said it's unfair to me. 
I asked him to wait for 18 months so that I can gain financial stability but he said it feels unfair to him.

I really do not want to lose my man because he is my everything and I am more than content with him

I recently said somethings that made him mad at me and he isn't talking to me now i am really hurting because I miss him and I don't want to feel abandoned again NO, OP.. you're correct. 

Do you want to attain financial stability beforehamd which is understandable. 

This doesn't even have to do anything with religion, it's common sense! 

With the high rate of divorce of today's modern world, yeah, you don't want to be left on the street with no career and no income.

"I have done a bit of thinking and have somewhat formulated my opinion but I figure I should get some other thoughts before I make a decision.

So I met this girl who's 19. She is super nice and we sorta became friends. I thought it was platonic and had zero intentions of changing that just because I thought our age and careers were at different points. I get along really well with her and even remember I wished I could meet a girl like her but I again did not intend on asking her out. Looking back there was maybe signs she liked me (compliments, friendly and talkative with me) but I thought that was just who she was. Anyways, she asked for my number and we've been been talking alot lately. She is a sweetheart of a person.

My problem is I feel so much older than her especially at this age range. If she were 30 and I were 37 I wouldn't really think twice. But 19 is just so young. I feel like a cradle robber even though she asked me and I haven't initiated anything yet.

Relationship wise we are maybe closer in years. I've been single a long time and haven't dated just because I've been focusing on my personal and professional life. I honestly think she has more relationship experience than I do. I would say she is mature for her age but god that just sounds like creepy justification.

I like the girl, and we get along. I just feel like I'm taking advantage of someone who is too young (and I haven't even done anything but talk with her!). At this point I'm leaning to somehow terminating whatever is happening. Before I do I want to see if any of you think I'm doing this prematurely. Should I let it play out a bit longer and see if it fizzles on its own? Assuming the consensus is to end it do you all have any idea how to let her down gently? She's a super nice person and it was ballsy of her to ask for my number so I don't want to hurt her and like I said I really don't have much experience in the relationship realm.

Thanks 19. Just two years ago she was underage (at least in my state.) I would find it difficult to handle all the criticism and comments. I'm in am age gap relationship but I'm 29. 18 feels like a completely different person as opposed to someone in their late 20s. You can just say you think it's best that you stay friends because of the age difference. [Practical Advice]"
"I'm 37 and she's 35, together for a bit over 2 years, living together. Recently she was showing me something on instagram that someone DMed her. While looking for it in her messages, I noticed a name of a guy I haven't heard about. Asked who that was and she said it's her colleague from work. She said they just send each other some funny reels from time to time. She opened the chat with him and quickly scrolled through to show me. While doing that I noticed some text exchange and asked if she can pause. She did and what I saw really surprised me - the guy said they should go for a beer/whisky (her drink of choice) catch up - to which she responded that it's necessary and she will let him know.

She claims that she didn't have an intention of going out with him (and didn't go nor made any plans) but she didn't know how to respond. Also states that the guy is older and has a wife and kids. She also mentioned that they went out a few times with her two other girlfriends from work and him. She says that this guy didn't have any other intentions than just to catch up.

While I want to believe what she is saying, it also doesn't feel entirely right. Any tips how I should interpret and handle this situation?

"Hello everyone,

It seems like my relationship is going downhill. My girlfriend is almost never happy with me and gets mad at everything I do. For example, we went to a festival last night (even though I hate festivals and she knows that but I went for her because I knew it would make her happy) and this morning she was telling me how we should have danced more, how we should have done more things and stuff - even though from my point of view things were going well and we were actually having fun. I feel like she always sees the bad part of things while I try to be more optimistic.

Another issue is our sex life. Although it has never been the best, a few years ago we used to do it regularly (twice a month or so). But this year we haven't done it even once. And I don't necessarily have a problem with that, but she also got mad at me for a few days when she found out I was watching porn. She used to send me nudes and I didn't need porn, but these days she doesn't send me those either. And I am tired of asking her to have sex or send me nudes because it feels like she always finds excuses not to come  at my place or send me things. And because I don't want to pressure her in any way, I resort to watching porn to relieve some stress. 

Also, I feel like she gets mad at almost every little thing I do that she doesn't agree with. In the last few months I've had a lot of stress regarding my career and I've told her that sometimes I might not be 100% when we go out, for example. Even though I tell her that, she always gets mad at me when we're in a restaurant and I look around, saying that I'm not paying enough attention to our relationship and to what she's saying. 

She seems to get mad when I go out with my friends too (although I am doing that only once a month usually). Last week I asked her if she wants to go out with me and she said ""no"", because she had some exams. I fully understood that, and some friends asked me to go out with them that day and I accepted. She got mad because I did that, I am still not sure why... I go out with her 10x more than I go with my friends and I always put here on the first place when it comes to these things, but I still fell that this isn't enough.

Should I break up with her? Or try to restore the relationship? Because after 4 years being together, it feels so hard just to let anything behind and start again... I'm sure you do care about her as a person, but you basically made a list of reasons why you should break up. Do you still love her and actually feel it in you to fight for the relationship or is it really just for the fear of starting anew? [Commentator's opinion]"
"My wife and I recently had a son in January, she quit her job a few months before the baby was born and I've been supporting us financially for the past 9 months or so. Quickly after the baby's birth we accumulated and have been bouncing between 500-1000 dollars in credit card debt which I've desperately been trying to pay off, medical bills from a hospital stay she had 1 month after giving birth, and big bills such as new tires and registration for two cars, and house maintenance looming on the horizon.

My birthday is right around Christmas, being that my wife was 8 months pregnant and newly becoming the sole earner in my family I did not expect any big gifts. Both my birthday and Christmas came and went and my wife didn't even do so much as make a handwritten card to give me, I literally received nothing. I let her know I was upset that I didn't receive even a card and through several different discussions and arguments I believed we had worked out our issues. I just recently purchased myself a father's day gift knowing if I want more than a card that I'd have to get it for myself, which is perfectly fine with me. I knew from the start there would be lots of added stress and I would have to make sacrifices to start a family. 

however, last night my wife said her friends are coming into town in August and she wants to get a couple tattoos with them while they are here. Being that just about every cent I make goes to bills and groceries I asked how shed pay for it and she told me she's got a secret stash of money that shed use. I shrugged it off and said okay, because it is her money. But as the hours have passed it's starting to bug me more and more.

 Shes had to of had this money hidden since before she quit her job before December, and I got nothing from her during the holidays and she led me to believe that she had no money to buy gifts with, and she's watched me struggle and fall further and further behind on our bills for the past 6 months. 

Am I wrong for feeling like me and our family are not priority's for her? And if so how do I confront her about this situation? You’ve been paying the bills for the past six months because you consider it your duty as a husband and a father right? Flipping every dollar to make ends meet. And now you found out that she had a secret stash of money hidden away all along while you were grinding for your family. Throughout the past six months she never mentioned this money, and never offered to pick up a bill or two to lighten your load.

That is wrong in so many ways, you’re definitely not in the wrong for feeling the way you feel man. Seems like your wife has a “what’s yours is ours, but what’s mine is mine” attitude. [Emotional Support]"
"I (25m) keeps getting unwanted attention from gay men. which I guess I appreciate because atleast there's people who find me attractive but it's kind of frustrating, I work out dress nice and I'm 6'5. All that for women but none would even look at me. There would be a point where these gay men would sexually harassed me in clubs or take advantage of me. It's disgusting to say the least. 

I don't know what else can I do. I really want a girlfriend to have a woman in my life yet none would even look at my direction. Is this normal? Any men have experienced the same thing? It's completely normal. Men are much more aggressive in pursuing others for sex than women are. It doesn't matter if they're gay or straight. Men and women are extremely different on this front. It says nothing about you. It's not like you're more attractive to gay men because of some inherent quality you possess. Any guy gets more sexual attention in a gay club than a straight club.

When you want to date women you have to hit on them. Make the first move. Receiving eye contact before you approach is nice, but it's more of a bonus than a necessity. [Practical Advice]"
"I (28 F) matched with a guy (31 M) on a dating app, and conversation has gone well. It's the most I've engaged with someone for a while. He asked for my phone number and I said no. He said he understood. I explained without too much detail that I got out of an abusive relationship a few years ago and had some stalking issues there still so I'm cautious and don't give out too much info too soon. His response was, ""You have a stalker? That must be flattering. Hahaha jk."" I responded saying ""no it's not, it was actually all really hard."" And then he apologized for making a joke of it and said it wasn't ""cool"" of him. 

Fairly, it rubbed me the wrong way. Tone deaf response, definitely. I just want to stop the conversation. But am I being unfair? I know people act dumb sometimes when someone shares something and they don't know how to respond. Or is this a clear sign that there's not going to be any empathy there?  I mean he apologized so there’s clearly a conscious there. 

Seems like he was trying to make a joke to make you feel better about it or be flirty or something and he didn’t realize how you would respond. You aren’t wrong to be uncomfortable but I wouldn’t necessarily end it all because of one bad joke. It’s a dating app so people are probably not used to being serious when they first start conversations [Commentator's opinion]"
"Two weeks ago i met this lovely lady on a Muslim dating app. We got along very good, same interests. We both are from Turkey living in Germany. The only problem is, she lives 500km away. But this past weekend she was on a wedding of her friends‘ which was 1 hour from me. We decided to meet on Sunday (yesterday) but she told me couple of days before that sunday won‘t work. So when she was at the wedding i jokingly asked her that we can meet up after the wedding (jokingly because the wedding would end at night). And then she said at 2 at night that we can meet now. Idk what got me but i jumped from my bed and drove off after that. 1 hour car ride and i was at her hotel at 3 at night. We talked a lot, got ice cream at McDonalds (she even offered to pay). And at 4:30 i drove home and she went to sleep at her hotel. But i was really surprised when i saw a text from her when i got home if i arrived. She really waited one hour til i got home. These past two days i am thinking about her all day. My car even smells like her. 🫠 So what do you think? Should i tell her that i have a crush on her or is it too soon and i‘d scare her away? I’m not familiar with Muslim culture. I think it depends on the woman. Some are ok with you expressing feelings, and others are turned off by this. 

You can lighten things up by saying, I like how you make me feel and I would like to pursue things with you for now. 

Depending on your culture, maybe tell her for now you would like both of you to cut off other people from dating apps etc and focus on each other.

"Met someone wonderful on Hinge a few weeks ago on vacation. We live on opposite coasts in the states but want to try to make it work! He (35M) is visiting me (30F) for the first time in my city and I am extremely excited but also slightly apprehensive about him staying with me for three days. Is it too soon? We’re not officially dating yet just talking still and seeing where this goes. Him staying with me feels like a very big step but is it on par with him visiting me and I should be more vulnerable? How do I go about asking him to get his own hotel room? Should I offer to get one for him?

One of my friends thinks my asking him to stay elsewhere even thought he’s coming specifically to see me and spend all weekend with me will send the wrong message about me and my intentions with him. The next step if this goes well would be visiting him. 

It’s early but I feel really good about him/this and want to proceed with intention and he seems to be in the same boat. Any advice would be much appreciated! 



 You're debating but you're not really talking about your actual comfort level.

What would you prefer?

* Him staying at your place and he sleeps on couch.
* Staying over and potentially cuddling.
* Throwing him in a hotel room.

What is most comfortable for you?

Stop people pleasing. What do you prefer to see happen?

Because if its hotel, then you should stick to that. It should be understandable, right?

>Thank you for coming to see me. I know we hardly know each-other and meeting up is the only for this to develop. But, I am not sure if I am ready to be sleeping in the same house together. Is it okay if we get you a hotel? I will pitch in on it. I need to be eased into this and I will probably feel a lot more comfortable the next time. 

That should be understandable right. If you're worth it to him, he will respect you and deal with it. 

Otherwise, if he is flying out and expecting you to put out when you haven't truly met him... Is that really the kind of guy you're down for?

Spending 3 days straight with someone you barely know, that's ALOT to take in for a first time. 

And who knows, maybe only book the first 2 days for hotel, by the 3rd... You could be open to it. [Practical Advice]"
"Context: I met this guy on work. Sometimes I would catch him looking at me then turning away suddenly whenever I would look at him. He would come to the place that I work at ( he works at another department ) multiple times a day, would ask what my name is, and while I was preparing his order for him, I could notice him staring at me. This goes on for about a month. Strange thing is, whenever I look at him, he snatches his gaze away. His manager once told me in front of him and that he is “good with girls”. Anyways, fast forward, I start liking him too, I tell my supervisor about it and she thinks it’s a good idea to be a matchmaker for us. Spoiler: she makes it too obvious that I like him and I think okay, this is over for me, he’s gonna lose interest. Now he doesn’t initiate conversation, kind of turned abit ‘cold’. BUT he still keeps staring and glancing at me whenever he thinks I don’t notice. Even my coworker told me he saw him staring at me. What’s the explanation behind his behavior? 
 I'm not really sure why he decided to be cold towards you all of a sudden but if he's still catching glances at you, he must still feel something or is fixated. Maybe now knowing that you possibly like him (as your co-workers make it obvious) he might be trying that to seem more desirable to you? (Possibly heard that girls like the cold guy personality) 

Try actually talking to him, I feel like nothing will happen with this when its been a whole month of just staring at each other. If you don't want to be direct asking if he's totally interested in you, you could ask to just hang out with him and deciding on what to do, you ask about his hobbies. [Practical Advice]"
"I (F21) hAve been seeing this guy (M32) for 7ish months at this point. We were talking about going away and I asked ""oo where should we go"" and he goes ""the bush so that I can r*** you"". I immediately had a pretty visceral reaction: ""what the fuck"" ""fuck you"" ""where did that come from"" ""what compells you to say sometbing like that"" etc. but took myself aside for a second to cool off. He knows I've had some marginal experiences and that would be a particularly sensitive topic for me. It was so fucking out of pocket and out of character. His explanation was that it was dark humour and that him and his friends make jokes about dark things. I just could not believe my ears. I kept on being like how could you possibly think that was funny even in any context ever ?!?!?!  

Anyways. 

I now feel very conflicted on what sort of person he is. He's never said anything of this nature before and had always approached the topic of sexual assault very carefully or seemed to have concern at least. 

Pretty fucked up from my point of view and it really really really left just a terrible taste in my mouth. Am I overreacting? What would you do??!!

What advice would have for someone who has the mindset of always feeling ugly? both on the outside and inside. It's like non stop thinking that i am, that i am not good enough m31 btw, feels like i will always be alone the way it's going.  Even regret splitting from my very toxic, controlling relationship of 4.5 years cause I feel  so ugly i won't find anyone else. Have gone on 
Dates but when they don't lead anywhere I blame myself like there is something wrong with me

It us absolutely head wrecking and I can't seem to change  ""Love people like love flowers""

You're not ugly, you just don't treat yourself well.
The reason why flowers fail to bloom may simply be due to insufficient nutrients, such as lack of water or sunlight.

Think of yourself as a flower, take good care of yourself, and wait for you to find the right nutrients, enough water and sunlight.

You will naturally bloom. [Emotional Support]"
"I will try to keep this short. My boyfriend and I use third party social media to send impromptu private and risqué photos. We FaceTimed this morning as usual, and I could see that he was in the mood, and he asked for photo to help take care of him. I happily obliged and sent the photo. However, the aftermath of this is where I am stuck. After receiving the notification that he opened my photo, my BF was silent on the call and spoke only once to call me pretty. The next 5-7 minutes were silent and I had no clue what to do/say. Then, he enthusiastically says, “hey baby!”, and I ask him if he had done anything with my photo and he replied that he already saw it and finished to it. I was kind of in shock and even now I just don’t understand his thought process. I would’ve like to been included or even told about what he was doing, not just have it mentioned to me after the fact, especially since I was literally on the phone with him. I feel like it was common sense to follow through considering he initiated here and any other time we’ve done this both parties were active on the call. Was it a fluke? He said he doesn’t know why he did it and it had nothing to do with embarrassment or nervousness. Am I right to feel used/betrayed/hurt or am I totally blowing this out of proportion? that sounds like a very small thing to be betrayed by.  He used YOUR picture to get off to.  Yeah it's a little weird when you think about it, but it's not like he was doing it out of attraction for someone else.  

If you want him to get involved then get yourself involved too, make it mutual [Practical Advice]"
"So I feel like I could make this way to drawn out so I’ll try to make it as short as I can. So for the story I’ll just call her H. We all ended up going on this trip through our colleges. Just so happens H is going a the same school I’ll be going to in the fall. Since in total it’s around 50 people on this tour group us young ones stick together. “When in Rome” ig we’ve been getting drunk and staying up about every night. (A week) ik it sounds horrible saying it outloud. 

From all this me and her have grown real close (drinking buddies) definitely real good vibe to her like on homie status. She’s  told me about her life, trauma, her goals. And 2 a certain extent me too. Well speaking on trauma she’s only had 1 ex and he abused and cheated on her. Well just keep that in mind. 

Last night she ran out of zan and finished off her cart that she smuggled overseas. So she was going through withdrawal badddd. So when we were hanging out one on one the night before the whole withdrawal stuff it got real late into the night and she ended up low key kicking me out cuz she said she can’t sleep in the same room as a man not even her brother after her ex.

So last night while she was feeling so ruff our friend booked her a taxi back 2 the hotel and I went back with her to make sure she’s ok. I spent the whole ride with my arm around her cuz she asked. Well I ended up just laying beside here while she was dry heaving and I just felt so bad I couldn’t help her. Like all I wanted to do was help her at the very least just put my hand on her shoulder and comfort her but I basically ended up laying with her till she just told me she doesn’t wanna be touched and just wants to be alone rn.

So that was 2 days ago and we didn’t get much time to talk yesterday cuz we both just were feeling like ass her from withdrawal and me presumably from the bender we’ve both been on. 

All this boiling down to say do I just bit the bullet and tell her how I feel straight up or do I just keep quiet? We have 6 more days together and I’m just not trying to make it weird between us.

It kind of saddens me (F20) to know that so many people believe in the saying “once a cheater, always a cheater”. I cheated on my ex who held a knife to me and forced me to have sex and give BJs, and for some reason I always ran back to him between the ages of 15-18. I received therapy, but the name calling, harassment, and outcasting still haunts me from time to time. 

When I met my current bf (M21), I cheated and eventually broke up with my ex. It was the worst time of my life physically and emotionally, being the HS proclaimed whore. I lost all my friends, had no one besides him, and heavily self harmed from all the hateful emails and anonymous text messages sent from random people senior year.  He was there for me though it all and I am beyond grateful he showed me how beautiful life could be. I have zero desire for anyone besides him and our 2 year anniversary is coming up. 

I was recently told that odds are I’ll cheat again in the future and I understand that may be the case (statistically speaking) but I really love him and it hurts to hear that. I don’t think I’m a serial cheater, because it’s only happened once, but now I have this thought in my head that I’m going to ruin everything one day in the future and cheat when times get hard because of this one comment. How do I cope with this feeling and do you all believe in this saying? I would like to think that people are capable of becoming better.

However, once someone cheats in the relationship... I am a firm believer that relationship is as good as dead.

Too much damage to sift through and its never going to be the same. A no coming back from kind of moment.

Usually its the letting go and doing better for the next relationship where people actually grow.

Can't really let the old you die when the relationship is keeping that part of you alive.

To move on from mistakes, you have to remove the entire storyline and write a new one.

A relationship with cheating, that story is ruined. Time to close the book and write a new one. [Commentator's opinion]"

Instead he'd leave me on delivered even though he'd be active on insta for a good while 

When he does give me his time of day the conversation always leads from sweet talk to somehow being sexual so this is where I ask my question.

 Sounds like a very direct and straightforward way to tell you she’s fucking busy for a week because she’s had a death in the family and she doesn’t have the time or energy to be on “had a few dates with” terms with a new person.

"Hi everyone,

Quick context:
We have been dating for a couple months now. This is my first real relationship, and have only been on a few dates with a girl before that. My girlfriend has had several relationships but none that lasted very long (a few months at most). My gf is also very comfortable with her guy friends and have slept in other friends beds’ a fair amount of times (before our relationship).

I need some advice on how to set boundaries with my girlfriend. Here’s a recent conversation we had that’s really confusing to me, and Im somewhat concerned about:

Around 3am she sent me a video of herself drunk, talking to me:
“I need to go to bed but you [unintelligible]. So we (her and her friend) sleep like [together] but I’m like [facing away].”

The conversation takes place the morning after.

She confirmed she was drunk and that she had slept at a friend’s house in Derry. Dylan (19M) is Canadian and only comes down for a couple of weeks each summer. She mentioned she slept in his bed and so did he.

I noticed from a Snap she sent that she was in a different bed frame and location, so I asked, “Whose bed is that lol?” She replied, “Dylan’s,” who she had previously talked about as being a friend she was excited to see. I then asked where Dylan slept, and she said, “In his bed.” I responded, “Like a heads-up would’ve been nice.”

Then she called me and said, “Hey, I thought you said you weren’t insecure,” referring to a recent time I said that I’m not an insecure person. I was so confused that I didn’t know what to say, and after expressing my confusion, she said, “I thought you would, okay have a good day, bye.” End of call.

She then texted me:
“He wasn’t even there the whole time.
He transferred to upstairs.
Deadass platonic sleepover.”

When texting, she mentioned the video she sent (which is very hard to understand) and said, “So like I did think of you last night, I also mentioned you. So like, fuck you.”

In the last phone call, she made it clear that she’s never been interested in him, there were two other girls on the pullout couch, and she wanted to drive home but they wouldn’t let her because she was too drunk (she’s told me other times where she has tried to drive when she’s drunk, but also had people stop her). She also said that Dylan was only there for 30 minutes before going back downstairs.

I want to stay together, but I feel like I need to  talk to her and maybe set some boundaries. How can I approach this situation without coming off as insecure or controlling?
 Male freinds are a red flag
Hanging out and getting drunk with?
Drunk in his bed ????

Theres no way that she’d be able to convince me they didnt have sex. 

Who sleeps in other mens beds while in a relationship. Ppl masturbate and have sex on those mattresses. Im not comfortable with at all. 

U might have to break up with her. Or atleast start inviting girls to get drunk and sleep on your bed. [Commentator's opinion]"
"My ex and I decided before our kid was born that we weren’t going to allow any pictures of her online. This came from our own wants of privacy as well as the protection of her from creeps online. Even while attending daycare we wouldn’t allow her to be included in anything public. 

We expressed this desire to all close to us soon after and everyone agreed to keep her offline. Aside from my sister accidentally posting a video on her story that was only up for a couple of minutes everyone respected our wishes. Aside from my mom. I don’t follow her on Instagram and I’m not on Facebook, so I don’t have access to her accounts. A couple of months after she was born I was on my mom’s phone and saw she had posted a picture of my newborn on instagram, showing her hands and feet. Not the biggest deal but I told her not to post anything else and that I wouldn’t be coming around otherwise. I don’t really see anything come up until earlier in the year where I see her Instagram open and it’s full of posts of her again. I told her again to stop but yet again I see her earlier today making a post on Instagram and again she seems to just ignore me. 

I’ve explained before why I do not want pictures online, including stories showing how it could get into the wrong hands. Her account is private but regardless I don’t want pictures online and I’ve been adamant on that stance since she’s been born. She disregards my wants and authority as the parent.

"I male/18, met my girlfriend female/16. 6 months ago. It was online. She lives in Syracuse, NY, and I live in NYC 3 and half hour ride.

When I first met her she told me she was 17 turning 18 in October. So she lied about her age I didn't find this out till yesterday.
After the first incident she would text me asking to to talk again. I said okay but it has to be a secret. Long story short we finally agreed to meet which was yesterday 6/29. I got her a bus ticket to come here. Things went well, blah blah. Her dad finds out he calls her and they start calling me. Then a deputy calls me too. He told me I wasn't in trouble. I spoke to her dad and helped him have him support and said I was sorry, and I didn'tnt know she was 16. I told the cop what I should do after this if I should block her, stop telling to her. And he said ""do nothing"" her dad thanked me for being supportive and everything. Then he sent me a text this morning saying how we would appreciate if me and her don't talk anymore and the police advise it too. I spoke to the cop and he said I am not in trouble. I don't wanna give up on her because she was there on my lowest time. I was thinking of calling the dad and telling him I feel, and how I wanna fix things. 1) Please try to write in complete sentences, it makes it easier to read and understand.

 In the time since, I’ve seen one other guy but ended it because I wasn’t ready or interested. My main prerogative has been finding myself, travelling, joining groups, focusing on my health etc.  

The thing is, this whole time I’ve not been able to imagine a future with ANYONE else but my ex, I’ve not been interested in trying to find anyone new (the guy I was seeing was an old friend who asked me out organically). I’ve had other men approach me but I’ve just not wanted to date.   

Lately I’ve been thinking about my ex nearly all day and I’m not sure how to proceed, because in this time I’ve decided that I actually don’t mind if I don’t have children, I’d rather just have him   

Now, I know he felt abandoned by me and he’s very stubborn. We’ve not spoken for probably 8 months… So how would I reach out or is moving on my only? I’m so anxious about not having the opportunity to see him again, I feel like I totally messed up but it was with our best interest at heart, I never wanted to hurt him, I wanted my absence to heal him.   Man, adulting is so hard. I feel really broken.  How about NOT contacting him.  Let the man live in peace. [Practical Advice]"
"my bf of 4 years cheated on me with my bestfriend for months. Would y’all stay too? We don’t have kids or aren’t married (thank god lol). Recently moved to San Diego, CA and prices are no joke here. That’s the biggest thing i’m considering before deciding to leave. He always talked about marriages and babies so this was the last thing i expected. Apologizes for being naive as my mind is telling me to run for the hills but my heart wants me to stay🥹Do all men cheat? Once a cheater always a cheater? Will he actually change? 
 Not all men cheat. But yours does so you should move on. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I’ve made it two the fourth date with a couple of women only to fall flat on my face and get rejected the next day.

In looking back I’ve realized that I treat the fourth date just like the first date meaning I’m just having fun and maybe asking some top level questions. 

So what is the expectation of a fourth date from a women’s perspective?! 

 Dude here, for context what kind of dates are the first 3 dates, what are you talking about with the women, and do you have any physical contact with them(ie: kissing, hugging, butt grabbing etc.) [Commentator's opinion]"
"I tend to jump into things too fast. I’m wondering, how long do you guys feel comfortable with keeping things casual while going on dates and having sex before you want to take things to exclusivity? I am looking for something longterm, but want to be rational and not suffocating. Maybe also mention how often you hung out regularly. 
 If I’m gonna have unprotected sex with them then it gotta be exclusive [Commentator's opinion]"
"My gf wants one but I have no idea how to do it I tried three times on her wrist but it still doesn't work, I bite a small area with my lips and suck it but still nothing shows up. Any ideas? technique is the key here! how hard are you sucking? are you biting hard enough? usually it’s a few nibbles and then some sucking (you should suck harder than you think you should; make sure the skin is being pulled up slightly into your lips so the capillaries in the vessels can break slightly) and then a hickey can start to form. it also depends on where you’re at on her body. places with thinner skin (like the neck, collarbone area, chest) have been better areas for me as a female receiver, and depending where on the wrist you’re at, the skin can be kinda thick. they can show up in as little as 30 seconds or take longer. i’ve had some show up an hour after the fact! 
don’t be afraid to go harder than you think! but if you notice your partner is in pain, stop! communicate with them and try again if they’re willing. practice makes perfect, as they say, so don’t be discouraged if nothing happens as you want it to the next few times. good luck to you and i hope everything goes swimmingly :) [Practical Advice]"
"my boyfriend (26M) and I (24F) have been dating for around 3 months. yesterday, his ex reached out to me and told me that my boyfriend has been liking her instagram stories. she sent me screenshots of him liking recent stories of her, even one in a bikini. she said he also swiped up on one, and they messaged for 4 days (when I asked what they talked about she said it was just about work but why keep the conversation going for so long?)

idk how to feel. I know social media isn’t real life but i’ve never had anyone reach out to me before. is this a big deal or am I overreacting? I don’t like the idea of my boyfriend liking another girls story let alone his ex  Have you talked to him about it? For me, I’d be immediately gone. Very disrespectful. [Commentator's opinion]"
"My boyfriend and I have been together for over a year now.
Over the past year there have been some worrisome signs of abuse as follows:
* He has used swear words while fighting with me (he was the one to start verbal abuse and over time I also retaliated by swearing back). He has called me a dumb b!tch, c*unt, piece of sh!t, lazy useless pig, fagg0t, l0ser.
* He used to punch walls and throw stuff in anger including my belongings and his phone
* He has driven the car rashly and angrily while I was sitting in the passenger seat
* He has brought his hand up to my throat momentarily during a bad fight and later said it was just to get me to stop talking
* He has twisted my arm during a fight and it kept hurting for 2-3 days after but he said he did it playfully like he would with one of the boys and that he did not know it would hurt me
* During a fight he said over phone ""I will punch your face and make you bleed"" (this was the most recent)


He says he's reducing such reactions and controlling his anger. The physical part has stopped since but the verbal abuse still continues to an extent.
I got scared and shared some of this with my mother and she wants me to call it off.

He comes from a dysfunctional family and I feel bad for what he went through, being raised by a single mother. And he is also responsible for her financially.
We are also from different religions so that's another point of contention for him (I'm secular so I am tolerant of his religion but he isn't much of mine. He wants our future kid to follow his religion).

The reason I have stayed:
He has promised it will get better and I do love him a lot and the good times have been really good. And I saw myself marrying this man. He can be a very caring and loving and trustworthy partner.

I have seen some improvement in him, but I do feel disrespected at times in this relationship. I'm scared of a future where I'll be in an abusive marriage.
Because I have read that most men do not improve/change.

I would like some advice and for others to share their experiences. Have you faced such a situation before and has your partner improved/changed?
I feel completely confused as to how to proceed, and some insights would be helpful.
I will also speak to my therapist about this. LEAVE NOW!! Please OP realise this is NOT love and he is manipulating you, Call the police and have them help you collect your belongings and escort you out

"So I've known this girl for almost 2 years now (since September 2022). We were together for 10 months before breaking up, then we got back together again recently, but even throughout the time we were not together, we were practically still together, with us doing everything except making it official. Lately, we don't enjoy talking to each other over phone or over texts. I told her about how I felt, and she said it was the same for her. It's different in person, though, as we both really enjoy our conversations in person. The problem here, though, is that we can't have a decent conversation over texts or on a phone call anymore, and I'm not sure why. At first, I thought that it was because we knew each other for almost 2 years, with us texting every day during that time, but now I am thinking that this is not the case anymore. I love her a lot, and I know I love her because I do not have feelings towards her anymore but I still choose her 100% of the time over any other girl in the world. She says its the same for her but I start to question this because she said that she is not feeling the relationship anymore and that she feels irritated when she texts me or when we talk on a call due to her feeling like there is a double meaning or a hidden intention behind everything I say. She says its not the same in person, however, so I am confused over this. The easy solution would just be to go out more, but we can't go out a lot because she has strict parents and there is some distance between us.  I tried talking to her about this, but she doesn't completely understand her own feelings, and neither do I. On one hand, I don't really think I care, but at the same time, it's eating at me with every passing moment. I watched my favourite football team play today and win their match, but throughout the whole match, this situation was on my mind. I really love this girl, and I put my all into the 2 years we knew each other, but I feel like we may come to an end. I don't usually ask for relationship advice but I really do not know what's next for me to do, so if there is anyone on here that could help, please let me know what I could do to take my next step. My man, there. Is a double intention. You’re hiding your true feelings and you will never build the trustworthiness it takes to have a loving relationship. You may love her and she may love you but I’m sorry to say that this feels over in the way you describe. I’d love to hear her side here and not from you. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I’m 25m, she’s 25f. So long story short, I met this girl at work through tinder. She works in a different department but at the same site. Anyway, she was cool and we started chatting. She said she’s never been in a relationship which is fair enough, and she was ready for one which is what I’m in the search for. Anyway, we went on a few dates, kissing, sex and all was seeming well, then just out of no where, I’m not ready for a relationship can we just be friends. I asked her, please don’t break my big heart at the start, if you don’t think you’re ready please let’s just, we’ll leave it here, but she insisted she was ready and now here we are. I just dunno how to react. I’m frustrated, slightly angry and don’t want to waste anymore time with her but we work for the same company and cross paths occasionally… She didn't use you. You can't reallyy know how you will feel in a situation until you are experiencing it. And for some reason the experience of dating you didn't live up to her expectations. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I’m a 22f and I went on a 1st date with a guy. It was nice, I had a great time, but I didn’t feel anything special when I was with him. He didn’t tell me anything about how it went for him and I just don’t know if I should give it a 2nd try or just stop things now. And how should I do it ? What can I say without sounding rude ? Or is it okay to just let the conversation die ?
Thank you for your answer !! There’s no way not to hurt someone when you reject them, but that doesn’t mean that you disrespect them. On the contrary, you value them enough to tell them what you feel. People get closure when they know the truth, don’t give a fake excuse for the sake of being kind. Tell him politely that you don’t want to see him again. [Practical Advice]"
"Okay me (f25) and my best friend (f22) each have boyfriends, in her case more of a situationship of several MONTHS. Our guys happen to be bestfriends as well. Both ""boyfriends"" previously have kids from past relationships. Recently my friend moved out of state for her job, and her situationship stayed for his. 

(Here's the tea about her boyfriend) He refuses to be committed to her despite her begging and pleading. Every now and then his baby momma (who is married with another kid) comes from states away to bring his daughter to see him. While the daughter is sleeping, he has sex with his ex in the hotel room. He also has a tinder and meets random girls. This is hard because ive known for quite some time and dont know how to tell her. Its hard to give advice to someone when i know the dirt that is being done. I hate being in the middle. I told my boyfriend i was going to tell her but he told me not to. Do I go against him and tell her or do I let it just play out?  
 Wtf. She’s your friend. Tell her! How is this even a question. [Practical Advice]"
"Heya, my gf 21f and I 23m have had a rocky start to our long distance, for reasons I can’t be arsed to type out to be honest. Anyway scene set and moving on. 

Naturally as we’ve begun long distance, and it’s started imperfectly and been handled imperfectly since, there’s been a few things brought up to each other. One thing I was aware of before but now I see it growing more as a problem is that she tells her mom every time we have a fight. I don’t know how much info she gives, I doubt all of it because to be honest some of these circumstances have only arose because of her actions. But regardless, I’m more aware of how her parents view of me is probably pretty bad, she says they like me, although don’t believe it and she wouldn’t say they didn’t like me even if they did, I don’t think. 

She has brought up comments from her mom in several conversations about these things, all revolving around the general idea that I’m being too harsh/mean/judgemental etc. I find it difficult because I do still have some genuine concerns for how our relationship is changing, and very little is being done to combat them. And now I feel I can’t bring anything up because it could upset her and make her family dislike me more. 

I can give more detail if you guys think it’s needed for this situation, but I’m mainly wondering how to approach this subject fairly, as I know she’s close with her family, or if it’s reasonable or justified at all to be thinking about it. For me, a boundary between our relationship and the opinions of family and friends should be made so that we can solve these things internally. I mean if we can’t solve it internally, that’s a pretty bad omen right? 

Or possibility two, am I just being too unreasonable should I just lay off and deal with the issues I have on my own 
 Don't take it the wrong way, but you are not entitled to decide what she can or cannot confide in to her mother. As long as she's not informing her about very private stuff like intimacy-related details and so on, you have to accept it. 

Regardless, it seems like you don't really have a positive view of her. I have no idea why it is like that, but her parents are the last issue you should focus on. 

Are you sure you like her enough to be together? [Commentator's opinion]"
"Context: we fought, haven’t spoken to each other in 3 days. She works late night during weekends 7pm - 7am shifts. 

I ignored her for few days she got mad. And now she seemed my text and hasn’t texted me in 2 days. She’s trying to get even. I can feel our relationship is heading to toxicity. 

We are probably both stubborn. No one wants to text first. And she hasn’t done anything shady to make me question her. To be honest. This is our first fight.

Yesterday she posted a selfie on her instagram story as well. I am also not sure if it was directed to me. Or she’s fishing for a new guy. (This is a pattern I saw for my exes) and it was 50/50. The one that posted with “skin” usually wants to fish. But she just posted a selfie. No skin or anything revealing. With music something along the lines of “f&$& love, I don’t need it” 

I am not sure what to do. She said she doesn’t use her phone at work. I caught her lying. I just haven’t told her that. She doesn’t text me at work but she texts other people.

She’s working right now. Only during weekends. 

We text on Instagram. I see her online on whatsapp. 

I just need help. It’s our first fight. 
Am I being paranoid? Is she being shady? Do girls chat late at night? Who could she be texting at this hour? (It’s 2 AM here currently)
 It smell bad. What you should do depend of the nature of your fight in the first place. If you yelled at each other for something stupid like the color of the new couch, just be mature and apologize to calm things down. If she insulted your mom out of nowhere, start fishing for a new partner. [Practical Advice]"
"I have noticed on at least two occasions that the contents of my wallet have been fanned out as if they were deliberately taken out and looked at after spending the night at my gfs house. I didn’t notice either time until after I left and got home. We have been dating for about 5 months now and she hasn’t said a word about it. I’m not really sure how to approach this. My past girlfriends have usually respected my privacy. I keep mulling over in my head exactly how I’m going to ask her why she keeps doing this, without her becoming defensive. I know damn sure I’m not the first guy who has encountered this kind of behavior. So, can anyone who’s dealt with this before tell me how you handled it, and what happened? TIA. Honestly,it sounds like your partner has boundary issues. I've been with my partner for over 10 years and I've never looked in his wallet without his permission. Perhaps she was financially abused or is trying to catch you in some sorta lie. Honestly red flag but id attempt to talk to her. 

5 months is hardly enough time to be snooping imo. Just flat out tell her that your aren't okay with it and if there is any resistance perhaps rethink the relationship [Practical Advice]"
"My bf and I have been dating for 4 months. I'm definitely not planning to have children with him yet. But since he keeps fantasizing about children, a wife and a house every day I decided to find out his ""timeline"". When I asked him he told me he isn´t even sure about wanting children, just discussing what if´s. He wants to live his life for the next 4-5 years and then maybe he´s ready. Maybe it´ll never happen. Okay. I continued to ask for his reason for maybe wanting children out of interest and he told me there is someone there to take care of him when he´s old. Idk what to think about this. My first reaction would be that I love children and want to see someone grow up. Imo demanding care from a child is unrealistic at best bc you never know if you get along and if the child wants to do it. His second reason is that is the ultimate proof of love since it´s a combination of both partners DNA. And also the love you feel towards a child is on a whole different level than everything else which i kind of get. Idk but the first reason that came up to his mind kind of irritates me  Wonder why he wants a wife? [Not Relevant]"
"36F - Are girls really out here “using”men for free meals? I have had a few guys tell me that girls they’ve gone on dates with from apps are using them for free meals.  I love a good meal but this seems ridic to me. 
One guy even asked me if I was going to pay for myself before we even met up, which made me really uncomfortable. I was raised very traditional so there are some aspects that I enjoy about dating a man but I don’t need a stranger paying for my meal; I’m not homeless. The way I was raised was if a guy asks me on a date and he’s picking the place, he’s taking me out and I’m assuming he had the funds to cover it. Whether I like him enough to go on a second date does not determine whether I offer to pay for myself, which I always do, and depending on the situation I may let him pay that time. I only do this if I am certain I want to go out with him again and there are no major red flags waving. 
Backstory- in my 20s, I did experience some backlash from men who I let pay for me and did not want to go on a second date with. 
Obviously there’s still a huge wage gap so I am not saying I think every girl can do this, especially if she has kids, but I think in general it is a good policy I’ve stuck to because then guys can’t hold it over us later. Just wondering if there are truly women out there doing this whole “free meals” thing or if that is a myth bc the guys make it seem rampant!
 Well, for me it isn’t like i need your money but it would be nice if you at least offer sometimes.  A lady who can take care of herself is so hot [Commentator's opinion]"
"My girlfriend came around to my house yesterday were we just hung out and watched some videos. Couple hours later she was on top of me and pushed for sex so I reciprocated. One thing led to another and I was fingering her. Eventually she wanted penetrative sex so she got on top and this is where problems arrive.

She had her orgasm took a couple seconds break as she aways does. Usually we switch position because I don't get enough stimulation when she's on top but she carried on going.

A minute after we carried on fucking and all of a sudden she complained of pain in her stomach. I asked if she was okay and she carried on going. She said she had pain again and so I said ""do you want to stop?"". She said ""yes"" so I immediately stopped. 

She hadn't complained about stomach pain before or after we had sex so I was maybe wondering if I did anything wrong.

The past 3 times we've had sex she has acted a little different. The first 1/3 she had her orgams and then when it was my turn decided I had to jerk myself off whilst she watched (I did kind of enjoy it). The 2/3 times my parents were in the next room so we were trying to be really quiet, which didn't work too well and so she suggested we stop penetrative sex (because it was too loud) and I jerk myself off again. And the 3/3 was what I've just said above (obviously i didnt jerk myself off this time because it was obviously not the right moment)

Quite a few times she has brought up what blue balls feels like so I confused to wether this is mayne a kink or an actual problem. She did have a panic attack the day before so maybe it has something to do with that. When I asked her what was wrong she just kept saying ""I don't know"". So I'm really not sure what to do or how to get her to open up about it.

If it is a kink I'm more than happy to try it, in fact I have a similar kink that goes hand in hand. But if this is an actual problem she's having why doesn't she want to tell me what's going on.

Relationship is fairly fresh, we met around 2 and a half months ago and because boyfriend and girlfriend one month ago. Maybe try asking her if she is experiencing pain during intercourse. Different positions can be more or less painful. Being on top may be fine but when you switch it hurts her. A lot of women will also struggle to express this in words.

If that is the case, encourage her to see a Dr and /or Gyno. A lot of reproductive conditions can manifest as painful sex. Also try different positions and ask her what she enjoys.

If that is not the case then ask her directly why she doesn't want to have sex where you both climax. If she keeps avoiding it then keep telling her how you feel. It could simply be she is selfish and once shes finished doesn't care about you. If that is the case, it might be best to reflect on if this is a healthy relationship and one you want to be in.

"I (23F) have a (30M) boyfriend, and he sometimes talks to me in a pet voice or as if he is talking to a child when it comes to intimate things. If I flash him he starts talking in a pet voice like ""wow"" or ""omg you look so nice"" but all in a way as if a kid was holding a drawing, instead of a deep voice and the way that he talks too makes me feel less of a hot or sexy woman and more as a cute kid. I asked him about it he said because he loves me and sees me as his baby that he respects, and doesn't want to be disrespectful to, but i'm not sure how to feel. Before we started dating and we were friends and he would tell me about all his dirty experiences and how flirty he was, frankly he had wondering eyes in the beginning and that led to some infidelity (we are trying to move on from that). I've seen his texts calling other women hot and bad, but i'm just cute and beautiful in his eyes. I'm not sure if he's just not attracted to me in that manner and that's why all these issues stemmed and why he talks that way and doesn't treat me like an actual woman in that sense. I am still going over the infidelity thing out (happened 7 months ago, not physical, but i found out 3 months ago) and it has been hard to get my confidence back or be convinced that he truly is attracted to me in a sexy manner.

"I need to vent to some bros

Had two dates with this cute girl, had a little foreplay before I dropped her off after 2nd date. A lot of laughs and stayed texting a lot between. 3rd date she was gonna come over and hangout for the evening. Very sensual and ended up fucking for 5 hours on/off. Some of the best sex of my life and felt like we had a real connection. She definitely had multiple O’s and she even said I was an undercover pornstar(literally best compliment I’ve ever received). She gave every indication that she absolutely loved it, even the following days she sent me a couple memes on Insta describing how good the sex was. 
The following week we had plans and at the very last minute cancels our plans after leaving me on read for 2 days but says how she was so excited for our plans and that we’ll rain check. 
Following that, she completely ghosts me while posting on her fucking story 😂 so I text her letting her know I appreciated the time spent and I hope she finds what she is looking for. 
Which she then replies saying she enjoyed the time and just wants to be friends.

I’ve definitely done my fair share in my past so no hard feelings, but damn. I deadass have never felt so played in my whole life 😂  yep, you got played, it happens.

"Not really what you'd think lol 

My spouse and I have been married for about 15 years. They came out as Trans/ACE. We have a great partnership - coparent, split finances, live as best friend roommates. There is zero sexual or overly intimate (cuddles, kisses, etc.) between us. They are perfectly happy, and all of their needs are met. 

However, some of my needs are not being met. The intimacy, having a masculine presence, etc.. It was suggested that I start dating.

My question: I am married. I have a roommate who is also my child's parent. The relationship is strictly platonic. How would I address this with potential dates? Would dates even be possible?

*No we aren't planning on divorcing or living apart. It isn't financially smart, nor does it align with how we parent and want our kid raised.* I am looking for masculine friends who can (hopefully) fill the need for intimacy (no ons, f.buddy, etc relationship).* When/if you get on tinder or another dating app or if you're already on dating apps, be sure to specify in big letters in your bio ""POLYAMOROUS"" or something similar so people have an idea of what's in store.

"I could really use some perspective here. I'm feeling conflicted about my friendship with K (30M), and I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or if my concerns are justified. We've been friends for five years online, initially bonding over a video game and chatting on Discord. At first, we were close, and he even used to give me in-game currency bought with real money. However, things changed when I turned down his romantic advances – the gifts stopped, and so did much of our communication.

Months later, we reconnected, and he apologized, but I noticed he started showering other women online with gifts and attention instead. It frustrated me because I saw these women taking advantage of his generosity while he seemed oblivious, just craving companionship. Our friendship became strained as I couldn't stand watching this dynamic play out daily.

Recently, he's become very close to a married woman in our game community, showering her with gifts and money. It's escalated quickly over just a few months, and he considers her his best friend now. I've repeatedly advised him to be cautious with his money and to value himself more, especially now that he's not trying to win someone's affection but just being generous to a friend.

I've voiced my concerns to him and others in our circle because I've known him for years and have seen this pattern before. However, it seems I've upset everyone by talking behind their backs and making assumptions. I feel torn because I care about K and want to protect him from being taken advantage of, but I also realize he's an adult who can make his own decisions.

Am I wrong for speaking up? Is there a way to handle this situation better? I'm not sure why you think it's ur place to get involved. Also it's kinda hypocritical to complain about them taking advantage of him when u accepted gifts from him in the past. 

You also talked to others about it? So ur gossiping about it? Yea I can see why ppl are upset that ur talking about them to other ppl. 

You are absolutely wrong and kind of a hypocrite and definitely a gossip. He's and adult. He can spend his money how he wants. Mind ur own business. [Hurtful]"
"I M18 have a crush on my friend who I will call ,S (F18) for reference we are both in high school but don’t go to the same school I met her about a year ago through a friend and we quickly became friends. I cannot tell if S thinks of me as more than a friend though. A few weeks ago we were at a party and her ride left before we got locked in I told her that she could sleep in my car she said she would bc she knows that I’m a guy that she can trust. So whenever I went to bed that night she was already asleep and whenever I woke up she was already awake and my head was on her lap. I apologized for that but she just laughed and said she didn’t mind. About 2 weeks ago we were texting late at night and the only part I remember about that is that I told her that I think she is very beautiful she told me that that was sweet of me but, she then asked me if I was drunk (I was) and I answered honestly, she responded with “you’re such a flirt when you’re drunk” which I thought she was trying to flirt with me there. Last week I asked one of our mutual friends (J) if S thought of me as more than a friend. Our friend didn’t directly ask S that question but J said she thinks that S sees me as a close friend. 2 days ago we were on a friends boat and it was very crowded me and S sat at the front of the boat and she used  my lap as a footrest she kept touching me with her feet too and we sat there together for like an hour talking. Last night S invited me as her +1 to a party we were there for about 30 minutes then the cops showed up and we ended up separate ways and we ended up at 2 different party’s but we were both to intoxicated to go get each other. So what I really want to know is should I take a chance at ruining our friendship and ask her personally If she wants to be more than friends or should I just stay friends and see what happens? Always take a chance!!!! Every chance you get an opportunity that is positive for you then take it. You got nothing to lose [Practical Advice]"
"My (38M) girlfriend (31F) of almost 2 years moved in with me last week. In the weeks leading up to it we were fighting more and more to the point where we almost called the move, and almost even the relationship, off. After taking some space to gain clarity and peace again, I came back every time telling her that we should give it another try, lessons learned, let's be better.

Our relationship dynamic is classic avoidant (me) with anxious attachment (her). However, I feel I deserve a medal or something, for the enormous progress I have made to opening my heart more, doing what feels like ""risking"" intimacy and staying present. I really want to make it work this time, because after a divorce 7 years ago and 3 failed relationships after that, I'm just tired of failing relationships and take responsibility for my contributions to those failures. As a matter of fact, I was the one who always breaks up. So I'm trying something new - find a quality partner and stick it out.

So I've been regulating my reactions and mood exceptionally well even if I have to say so myself. I don't snap at her, there are no sting in my tone of voice. However she just can't seem to help herself sometimes. Getting short, cold, critical. And these things flair up my anxieties. I also feel a sort of anger, because the things she says is falsely accusatory and overall just super negative energy to be around. She wasn't always like this, but after learning about how overbearing and dominating and bullying her father was when growing up, it's like she's still acting out against that, even today. She needs to be loud and be heard because her voice was always silenced when she was young.

Either way, it makes me to overall feel quite miserable much of the time. It feels like I have to walk on eggshells, or she'll just explode. I don't know when she's okay and when not. Trying to bring things I feel is important to discuss up with her is received extremely poorly. And all these behaviours only came out about 6 months ago. I feel my happiness has taken a severe knock. All I am left to do is try to forgive her as best I can and meet her again with care and love.

Is it supposed to feel this miserable? I thought I'd really give a long-term relationship an honest try, and thought she would be a good partner, but I'm hating most of it right now. Please give me some advice or hope?? Thank you. Maybe therapy could be helpful so you both can learn how to communicate the right way with each other? [Practical Advice]"
"So I feel in a slump. I'm 31 and still have never been married. Most of my 20s I was working and going to school full time to get my 3 degrees. 

I feel unlucky in love. My longest relationship ended because he cheated. And I just had a relationship of two months end because he said he's too busy for a girlfriend. 

I just feel like I'll never meet my husband and I won't have a partner in life. 

I'm starting to question what is so wrong with me. 

I'm a really not pretty enough, or smart enough or funny enough? 

Advice please.  i don't know where you are from, but I think 31 is just a normal age to not be married yet. Hell, I even know people that got married in their 50's. You should just do what you like, and focus on yourself. When you do that, you might even gain some confidence in yourself. People like people who like themselves. Because that's hella attractive. You will find your person if you put yourself out there and start liking yourself a bit more. You just had a bit of bad luck with the people you met. [Emotional Support]"
"How should I tell her? Do you think this is the end if I bring it up now? I feel that I have to bring it up no matter what but how should I go about it?

We have been in a relationship for 1 year and she asked about my degree and I just kind of brushed it off till her friend asked me and I lied. I have stuck to that but try to not bring it up too much. Now I love her and can’t get a good night sleep because of the stress this is causing me. I have so much anxiety about this I am basically stressing all day and night. 

For a bit of background, I went to school but left after a year to take care of an ex with medical problems, it was a mistake but I got a fine job and kept moving up there. The pay was fine and it allowed me to take care of my ex. That relationship ended and I moved one 2 years past and I met my now girlfriend. She is lovely and I am lucky but it hurts every time school is brought up. I don’t know how to break it to her and what to do next. 

I also have been looking for jobs and she is so supportive but I can’t tell her the reason I don’t get the job is because of my degree status. Most of my friends know and they let it slip every so often over the last year but she seems to not notice. I am a fool for not telling her sooner but now I am here and need some advice.

Anyhow this is a throwaway and I really just need some advice on next steps.

TL:DR I fucked up told my GF I have a college degree when I don’t, now I need to tell her, but how? Listen, it's not the biggest lie ever. Drink a shot of vodka for courage and tell her you need to tell her something. Say the reason why you lied in front of her friend was that you were feeling insecure and were scared of disappointing her or scare her away, but that you're very stressed because you don't like hiding things from her. She will understand. [Practical Advice]"
"Hii I would love to hear your opinions. Me (20F) and my boyfriend(23M) have only been together for a few months now and I had went to his house the other day for the first time. when I was there he had a surprise for me and it was lingerie. There was 2 body suits both a size small and I am a bit chubby so I fit medium or large and he knows that. As I was looking at it, it had no new tags, the brand was Fenty. He had me try one and it couldn’t even get passed my tits, then as I was going to try on the next one, I literally looked at the crotch and there was dry DISCHARGE literally I got so grossed out. I didn’t say anything at all to him and told him I didn’t want them, they don’t even fit. I felt weird the rest of the day with him and went home early. Now I’m thinking where did he get the lingerie? who wore this lingerie? To be honest after thinking I feel like he stole it from his sister or still had it from a previous relationship, which he hasn’t been in one for “years”. He is now my ex  That's fucking gross. I'm not usually a break up with him kinda person but that's so fucking gross [Commentator's opinion]"
"So basically I went through a break up, it was my first relationship stayed together for 2 years. She went abroad to study and started lying to me about her whereabouts the second she landed, was very disrespectful throughout the relationship, shit load of issues. Not nice to me at all but nice to everyone else like wtf is even that, I endured it all till that day i broke things off. People who got back together after a break up, why did you do it and did it get better this time?  No,  they're never going to be the person you fantasize they are. [Commentator's opinion]"
"My ex-boyfriend and I met while I was doing a semester abroad in Europe. He lives there and I live in the US. We met pretty early on in my semester so we were together for about 3 months before I had to go back home. Honestly, it was the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in. We talked every single day, and were quite inseparable. However, I expressed early on that I didn’t want to do long distance, which he understood despite our growing feelings for eachother. 

Because I knew I was leaving, I feel like I gaslit myself into believing I didn’t love him as much as I did. He really loved me and wanted to try and make it work, but I was still pretty adamant about splitting up when I got back home. For about a month after I got back we were still talking everyday, and basically still together (neither of us were interested in seeing other people). It wasn’t until a couple weeks ago that I finally actually split from him, and the reasoning was because ever since I’ve been home we’ve been arguing more. Most of our arguments have to do with him being a really jealous person, and getting upset when I’d tell him i’m seeing male friends of mine (basically all of my male friends are gay or in commited relationships, which I have emphasized many times ). So I ended it because I was tired of defending my innocent hangouts, but to be honest it was mainly because I felt like it needed to end anyway, since as I said I never wanted to do long distance. 

Now it’s been about two weeks since we split, and I can’t stop thinking about him. I feel that as more time passes the more I realize I really do love him and it’s hard to let go. Part of me feels like I took the easy way out instead of letting it take it’s course. Now I don’t know what to do, because I already ended it. And even if we got back together, I have no idea how we would move forward. I came here because I don’t know what to do or how to feel. I want to talk to him but I also don’t want to hurt him more or hinder his healing. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Think about the consequences of your actions before you carry them out. [Hurtful]"
"
I was seeing this girl for 2 months, which is short but it was intense and serious (going out 3 times a week, some vulnerability around our issues and wanting to make this work). She recently decided that she’s going to her hometown for the summer (2 months), which prompted a very long and messy breakup. At first, she said that she feels like this won’t work long distance but was very insistent on being friends. 

I said that I can’t think of her platonically, and we agreed to just ‘take things as they come along’. We went out the next day, and she invited me over to her place and was being very affectionate overall and wanted to discuss what we’ll do while she’s away. Right before the day ended, she did a 180. She said that we’re going in circles, and that there’s already emotional distance here which means that long-distance will make it worse and that she lost romantic attraction.

I turned very cold and left, but reached out to her a few days later because I wanted closure. We met up, she told me that a joke I made that day threw her off. I had given her one of my bracelets, and she asked me if I wanted it back because we might not be on speaking terms by the time she’s back. I joked and told her that she can just give it to a mutual friend. This apparently prompted her to start thinking about how complicated the situation can end up being and made her ‘realize that she lost romantic interest’.

She said that she doesn’t usually like being friends with exs but that she wants to try with me, and asked if she can text me in a few days. I gave her a very halfhearted okay because I’m not sure if I wanna be friends but didn’t wanna make that decision now.

I’m just very confused right now because I feel that the joke I made wasn’t that big of a deal and she could’ve communicated that it made her uncomfortable. Was this actual loss of interest or a fear response? Is she likely to regain feelings once she’s back?

Also, I’m not sure whether she wants to be friends due to guilt or whether she really wants to.   No, mate. She's not that into you. She realized you two are incompatible, and she doesn't see a future with you. It's best for you to go no contact and move on with your life. [Practical Advice]"
"my boyfriend and I have been together for over 1.5 years. We hang out alot, he normally initiates it and is good at balancing me with his friends, alone time, work and school. 

I notice that when he does ask to hang out, which is more than 4 times a week I always say yes. He’s still in school so he has a part time job that’s 4-cl and I have a full time 8-5. We normally hang out when he’s off and finishes at the gym. Even though I should probably be sleeping by the time he’s back for the gym, He still comes over or vice versa. 

Sometimes (which is rarely) when I ask him to hang out he’ll say he’s tired from work or wants to hop on the game but he’ll see me in a day or two. I have run into the issue that whenever he asks me, I always say yes even though I know I should take a rest or watch some tv by myself. He lives with his two best friends and I currently live alone, so I feel like I’m always alone and want to be with him. He doesn’t have that problem.

Today is sunday and he suggested that I come over after I finish my reset (we saw each other wednesday through saturday evening). In my head I know i should probably get to bed early for work- but I really would like to see him. I’m trying to figure out how to balance and just say no when I know I should probably stay home, or if it’s even healthy that I am so quick to say yes to hang out with him (or seeming desperate). 

TDLR: I have trouble saying no to hang out with my bf because i hate being alone. He’s fine with taking time for himself whenever he wants a day or two alone. I feel desperate.  Just say you think it's better to go to bed early for work. Tell him you'll see him the next day or something. [Practical Advice]"
"My boyfriend has always been a little chunky but reasonably fit, exercising 2-4 times a week depending on his schedule. We're not taking six pack fit, but just a mild 'dad bod'. It's never been a problem for me.

Recently, he's started turning his fitness journey up to eleven. He goes 48-72 hours without food and still trains Thai kickboxing during these prolong fasts. He started doing these things a couple of weeks ago and the weight is just shedding off. I'm so proud and happy for him, but as someone who has struggled with an eating disorder in the past, I'm worried that he may be developing one.

It seems like whenever we meet to eat, he's finally breaking a 40+ hour fast. And even when he does eat, he eats keto. Normally he'd grab something like a burger at our usual spot, but he's now opting for salad bowls with grilled chicken, eggs and no dressing. He says that he's avoiding carbs because it means he can get back to ketosis faster in his next fast, butt that sounded like someone with an ED rationalizing.

He says that what triggered this journey was him meeting an old friend from high school who told him he looked exactly the same as when he was in high school, when he was quite a bit heavier.

When I was younger, I struggled with orthorexia, so I'm worried about him. I know these kinds of comments can be the exact kind of fuel that develop into eating disorders.

When I brought up my concerns, he just laughed me off and explained that he was just trying to be healthier. He showed me fasting salts and multivitamins that he was using to convince me that the fasts weren't dangerous, but that really just made it feel worse to me. Like if you need pills to make sure you don't damage your body, surely what you're doing can't be healthy?

Despite my concerns, he's been going for some electric inbody scans at a health lab that have showed the fat literally just melting off. He's dropped like 3 kilos (6.6 pounds?) over 2 weeks and says that he'll stop once he loses another 2-3 kilos. But again, that sounds like what I'd tell myself when I was struggling with my ED.

So reddit, tell me if I should be concerned. Should I ask him to talk to a doctor? How can I help him out here? He doesn’t eat for 2-3 days??? Yes. That sounds like an ED to me. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I broke up with my boyfriend last Monday.

Long story short, he really betrayed my trust and disrespected me.

Now it's been a week, he's saying that if we are a strong couple (like he thought we were) we should be able to move past this.
I feel as though I've been pretty strong for the past three years, moving past his occasional hurtful behaviors and boundary crossing. Of course it is not all bad, but there have been 4 major instances of disrespect or just flat out meanness.

Anyway. I am feeling really down and today I reached out asking if he could come over. He said yes but then I changed my mind, told him I had plans with friends. He was okay with that, but when I came home I told him it wouldn't be a good idea for us to hang out.

This is all so incredibly brief and missing a lot of details. So I guess my question is-- how do I stay strong, honor myself and my boundaries, and not cave in just to make him happy and take the oath of least resistance? I'm trying to do right by me, after taking one too many on the chin.  Don't call him and ask him to come to you. No matter how bad you feel, do not call him under any circumstances.

"I'm 21 year old male long story short went round friends uni party met this girl around 2am she seemed interested in me started playing with my hair, tiggling me. 5am we left she went back to her flat I went downstairs to sleep, I then messaged her saying there's not space here to sleep can I stay round yours she said yes I went round there and we started cuddling, playing with my hair, tiggling 

I got more info from a friend the next day that she was mad that I didn't make any moves and that I was the first man she ever chased sorta thing. I knew I should've atleast kissed her that night I feel stupid but I'm not the most confident person so I didn't unfortunately. I did actually like her as shes the first girl that's ever showed me that much attention. 

I messaged her a couple of days after the party saying it was nice meeting you do you want to hang out some time and she hasn't responded for 5 days. It's literally the only thing on my mind and it's making me regret not doing anything that night. What I want to know is can I do anything or should I just leave it at that?  If she hasn't responded in five days then she's not that interested in you. Maybe she was surprised that you didn't make any moves on her and maybe she thinks that you're boring? But you did what you felt was right at the time and if she was truly interested and liked you, believe you me she would let you know or at least get back with you. I would leave her alone and move on. [Commentator's opinion]"
"My gf wants me to baby her, so i was kindly touching her hair, sweet kissing her, and keeping her between my arms. 

So what is the best way for you to be babied? Physical touch is my #1 love language. Gentle touches in any form while going about mundane activities make me feel weak in the knees. A subtle hand hold or playing with my fingers. Super soft strokes of my arm or leg. Hugs from behind. A quick kiss on the cheek. Cheeky tap on the butt while passing by.

I can totally lose my train of thought in the middle of a sentence if I am gently and subtly touched in a sweet way. I love the more overtly sexual touches too, but the corny shit is what gets me. [Commentator's opinion]"
"Navigating a long-distance relationship for eight months, the relationship was lovely and straightforward. Both parties were happy and seriously committed. However, things soon turned darker as my trust issues were triggered by her outgoing vibes. She has an Instagram account with around 800 followers; she's popular, which means she gets a lot of attention and possibly admiration. I don't like to control her or anything; she used to reassure me every time I asked and even helped me with my overthinking whenever I asked something.

However, I always felt bothered by her interactions with guys, even though she assured me she didn't interact with any guys. Despite her reassurances, my trust issues and overthinking caused havoc and chaos. Every time I pressured her about something that bothered me, or about her past relationships, she would yell at me. She would say I was doubting her or not trusting her, and I don't blame her reactions since she had traumatic life experiences as much as I did.

Now, I feel like I lack self-respect for seeking her out while she's trying to go cold turkey and drop everything. I really, really love her and appreciate her company, and I cannot truly dare to move on without trying to show her I am not this kind of person. The trust issues and unhealthy behaviors were based on a previous traumatic experience where someone was lying to me the whole time. I'd be a fool to say I wasn't projecting my doubts and constant interrogations onto my girlfriend. I am genuinely regretful for becoming like this mid-relationship. All she sees now is an immature, selfish person who constantly doubts every move she makes.

I cannot give up on her just yet. I really want to put in the effort to show her I am different than all of this, but she insists on giving up and cutting me off. She is now trying to have no contact or even ghosting me for good.

Please, I need insights as I am desperately seeking to change for her and be as I used to be. If she wants you out of her life, leave. Now. 

It's not up to you to impose your will upon her or force her to be your girlfriend. 

Repeated false accusations of cheating are a form of verbal abuse. Constantly trying to control her behavior and who she's allowed to speak to is a form of abuse. 

It doesn't matter who cheated on you or hurt you. Your behavior and treatment of her are unacceptable. 

Get therapy and leave her alone. [Practical Advice]"
"in my desire to get him to initiate sex, i’ve given him plenty of opportunities but he either doesn’t take them or he just waits for me to do it.

last night we were in bed, and he legit just laid his head on my breast, cuddling me and that was it. when i asked him later if he had been trying he said yes, badly.

we have been married for four years, and i really love the guy, but i never ever feel sexy or wanted or like sex is something he wants rather than something im making him do.

we have had this conversation a few times before, he knows what i like and he def knows what doesn’t work (had a bout of a few months of just rolling over and grabbing my breasts), and it got better for a bit (he was a bit more involved) but god, its really making me feel like shit and now i get the ick so bad i can’t take it.

its making me feel really ugly, and now late at night i get this lump in my throat and horrible cringe feeling. and i know we’re gonna have to talk about it *again*, but how do i stop feeling so gross about it and why does it keep happening? It sounds like he just doesn't feel comfortable being overt and forceful and he never was if this has come about due to frustration over you always initiating. Not all men enjoy being the aggressor type and it feels like you're trying to force him into a role he doesn't feel comfortable with.

You say you've told him what you want and he's not doing it. When you told him what you wanted did you discuss his comfort with what you were asking for? Like really, into the weeds discussions about exactly how he feels doing every move you want? I know it's not a sexy discussion but it's also not fair for you to put these expectations on him if he actually hates doing it. Has he explained to you why he doesn't initiate? When he tries to initiate doing what feels comfortable for him, it sounds like you reject him. I totally understand why you're frustrated and not feeling desired but he's probably feeling the exact same way. Like, when he tries it still isn't good enough so what's the point. 

If you went along being the initiator for most of your relationship, what changed recently that made you feel like you didn't want to, or couldn't, do it anymore? Finding out what that is and the emotions underpinning it is where you need to start breaking this down from. [Emotional Support]"
"So when I was in college last year, this guy who made the first move had walk up to me and talked to me on my table, ever since that we have became very close, gotten to know each other very well and had some romantic moments. Six months later he had to move to a different state due to personal problems and I was so sad and heart broken when that happened. 

When I got hired to a new job, I recently met this guy 3 weeks ago and he was showing me around and training me. We’ve talked and gotten to know each other slowly and seem to became interested in each other which made me happy that I can finally move on from the last guy, but that same day he told me he will be at work for 2 more weeks before leaving because he is going to the military. That made me sad and it seem like he was sad too, after that I never seen him again at work. 

Now a few days ago I met this guy from a dating app, we’ve matched before around 4 years ago but really never talked. But since we’ve matched again we started to talk more often and today I just found out he is moving to a different state.. after that I just wanted to cry because it seems like every time I think I’ve found the perfect guy to date that I’m very interested in.. it never goes as planned and it seems like I’m not lucky when it comes to dating. I don’t know if this is God way of telling me that, these guys I was interested in just isn’t the right one for me.. or keep waiting until god gives me the right man that will treat my like a priority and a queen because he knows I deserve that kind of love and treatment from the right man. ✨💕 Lowkey had similar experiences... but mine would be that they would suddenly have problems (or excuses); they would basically just falter. I was hurt at first, but I took that as a sign that they aren't meant to stay in my life and they aren't supposed to be a partner or the one for me. I just cherish the good memories, and I don't hold on to them. [Emotional Support]"

"So I have the opposite of the normal problem that most girls face with guys actions and words contradicting each other. I’ve been seeing this guy for the past month and I’ve unexpectedly fallen so hard for him. 

I’ve told him that I really like him and mentioned that I wasn’t sure what he was looking for and he confirmed that he is also not sure of what he’s looking for. We’re both in our mid twenties, I don’t know that he’s ever had a serious relationship before. He’s nothing like anyone I’ve ever met or dated- in all of the best ways. 

So he tells me he doesn’t know what he wants but his actions are telling me that he wants to be with me??? He does all of this super sweet stuff for me, is planning stuff for us to go do later in the summer. 

He makes “jokes” when I talk about my future goals of having a big farm “let’s do it” in reference to buying my dream piece of property. The first time we (unexpectedly) had sex he rubbed his hand up my leg- I hadn’t shaved in a week or so, I made a comment about it and he said “natural, sexy” and smiled at me. The next morning when we woke up he stared into my eyes for a moment, went to get up out of bed, leaned back in towards me to kiss me, turned to get off the bed and then leaned back in for another kiss and asked if I needed anything????

He fucking rubbed his nose on mine one of the first times we kissed???? Like just all of these sweet little gestures??? Am I crazy for thinking he’s in love with me???
 Take his word for it; ""doesn't know what he wants"" does acknowledge some interest on his part, however it disclaims the likelihood of commitment thereof. 

Having read the signs he's given thus far (and they are ridiculously obvious he's into you) I'd inquire about his past relationships or/and upbringing; there's always a reason for such hesitance. I emphasize, just inquire, don't *shrink* him.. [Commentator's opinion]"
"My boyfriend and I have been in a very committed relationship for 6 months. He is now backpacking Europe for two months. He invited me to join him for few weeks but I wasn’t able to travel for visa reasons. And tomorrow is our 6th month anniversary and he told me he is going sightseeing with a girl he met at one of the hostels. So apparently, there were about 10 people from that hostel that started hanging out together and that girl has a plan to go to the same city as my boyfriend tomorrow. So they decided to do sightseeing together. And I feel comfortable about the fact that he’s travelling alone with her especially on our anniversary day. Am I wrong that I get mad and jealous? My boyfriend told me he told that girl about me. this is kind of how traveling solo works. you link up with random people and go on adventures. ive met tons of people of both sexes that were just friends and made traveling alone easier when you know someone. i wouldnt worry too much about it

i dont know if people actually celebrate 6 month anniversaries or not (i dont), but it def feels like you may be putting more weight on this than he is? [Commentator's opinion]"
"My partner and I have been together for almost 4 years. We started dating in grade 10 and we are currently 2 years out of high school. We have lived together for the last 2 years of our relationship (he moved in with me). 

Every time I ask him to do something he either forgets or doesn’t do it properly. For example, today I went to work and he had the day off so I asked him to put a load of washing on (work clothes). I made sure to state that I needed work clothes for tomorrow. I come home and he onto put his work clothes onto wash leaving mine in the basket. When I asked him why mine weren’t put on he get extremely defensive and basically saying it’s ’not his fault’. He then ignores me to play his games etc. 

This isn’t the only time it’s like this though. He always forgets to do simple (everyday) chores that need to be done around the household and I am getting really exhausted from having to remind him everyday to do these simple tasks. He has been assigned one ‘main’ chore of taking the rubbish out at night but he even forgets that. Its really affected my feelings towards him because I feel like i’m ‘mothering’ him all the time.

I have spoken to him about these feelings on multiple occasions but he just says ‘sorry’ and he will do it next time…. but never does. 

I don’t know what to do anymore but I’m so tired of reminding him of his basic chores everyday and I’m also tired of being treated like i’m the ‘bad’ guy for constantly getting mad about it!  You leave. As long as you stay with him, he will not do better. Why would he? He has someone at home to do all of it for him or remind him to do it. He doesn't have to grow up. [Practical Advice]"
"I (25F) first said it doesn't matter cuz I'm tight anyway but he (28M) then asked what my preference is. I've seen his dick before, it's big, so I just said ""length"" but he isn't replying back now. Was I supposed to say something else?? As a man, that was a stupid question to ask as it was definitely a trap question and there was malicious intent with it. A lot of men are very self conscious about their penis size because of society and porn. 

So you saying length probably hurt him as he probably thinks he is small length wise. Its not your fault you were honest, he question was dumb and he shouldnt have asked if he didnt want an answer [Commentator's opinion]"

I responded that it was okay that it was awkward but I would definitely hangout with him this weekend. 

I haven’t heard anything back from him since I replied. I’m just confused why he asked to hang out if he didn’t really want to? Idk should I text him? HELP if he didn’t respond to you and didn’t follow up about the weekend, I’d let it (and him) go [Practical Advice]"

How do I get over this? What’s the secret?  Some people are naturally better at being alone. But you're not really even talking about that.  Do you not have any friends, or family to connect with? Why do you need a man to talk too? Are you looking for quick validation? Focus on friendships. 

Personally I like being alone. Or I at least need alot of it. The secret? Well I like myself, I know I have value, I know I am loved,  I know I'm beautiful, I enjoy my own company, I enjoy doing hobbies and activities alone and I don't need outside validation. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I want to know ur perspective on this. My partner wants marriage and kids with me and a house. We are currently at his place. I recently found an old notebook where he wrote love letters to his ex. He had written down, “Marry me one day” and goals about buying a house with her. The girl left him for a rich guy. Anyway, long story short, I realized he wants the same with me and it makes me feel a certain way that he basically asked his ex the same things. Should I be concerned? I know it wasn’t his fault in his last relationship but is this kinda sketch?  He has always mentioned he wants a life partner and is ready for marriage and kids. I guess I feel a little ….idk, like I’m just another girl he throws these words to. It is a big thing to want marriage with someone and I guess what I’m trying to ask is …”is he using this question loosely?” I am kinda a little hurt he already asked this big question to somebody (I know I know…I didn’t know him at the time and everybody has a past, but it kinda tugs at me)  It’s not sketch to have a past. Haven’t you told other people you loved them before? Are you still in love with them now? If no, calm tf down and don’t do anything stupid. [Hurtful]"
"I am F (26) and my boyfriend is M (25). He is the kind of man out of a DREAM. He’s a provider, he pampers and spoils me, emotionally supports me, makes me feel like i’m a goddess. Everything has been great between us, and i could see myself spending my life with him. With all that being said, he admitted he was my STALKER before we met. 

This started when I found a reddit thread about a woman being stalked by her boyfriend prior to their relationship which sounded oddly familiar. i jokingly said that it reminded me of him, and playfully asked if he stalked me. he confessed that he had. 

he was designing a website for my employer, at the time i worked at a women’s clothing boutique. i modeled for the brand, which is where he found modeling photos of me, and admitted he couldn’t get me out of his head. he said my eyes in the photos felt like i was looking at him through the screen. he proceeded to go to the store where i worked, to find out my information from my coworker. 

he then proceeded to find my instagram, dive deeply into it, and then start to sit outside of the store to watch me. he said it was only a one time thing but i think he may be lying. 

there were other signs, like knowing information about me without me telling him, and his openness to confessing his deep obsession with me. he admitted he keeps a box under his bed with things he’s taken from me. small insignificant objects like used napkins, tissues, hair ties, etc, things that he keeps to remind himself of me.

i have to admit, i find this intriguing and almost charming, that he is so head over heels for me. i’m coming here to see if i’ve lost my mind for feeling this way? i also am a tiny bit creeped out, but i’m so in love it really overpowers that feeling. but how much of my love could potentially be manipulated? we’re best friends and i’ve never been happier. Am I crazy for wanting to continue our relationship??? Are you dating Joe? [Not Relevant]"
"poly situationship 

so we are both in our early 20s and he has been in situationships before and was/is in one while we started talking and getting to know eachother. me? never. i’ve never even been in a relationship. he is interested in having a polygamous marriage in the future and also wants to explore himself sexually yet he has expressed he doesn’t want to lose me. at first i had considered the whole polygamous thing with him because i knew it would make him happy (mistake ik) but as time progressed i realized that this would make me incredibly unhappy. i feel like i lead him wrong in believing that i could live the future he wanted but that’s not really the issue. i love this boy and i’m pretty sure he loves me but i’m also very concerned about our future together. he’s expressed he isn’t sure he can be in a monogamous relationship bc of his finances but he recently went on a date with the girl he was in a situationship before before me (after telling me he was “finished with her” because he was really interested in me). the girl before me doesn’t want to be in a polygamist relationship either and doesn’t want to share him. i feel bad for the girl and feel bad for myself. he says that she’s leaving for medical school in the fall so i’d have his primary attention but that just feels wrong. 

my question is, am i being played or manipulated ? should i leave now before i get any more involved? or is he just a young man trying to figure his life out? sos🥲 STOP IT.

This boy is a huge waste of your time. He can't afford monogamy? But he can afford to take another girl on a date? And his big reassurance is that you're going to get more of his attention when she leaves for school?

Please stop. He is a child who wants to be a fuckboi and is calling it polygamy. [Practical Advice]"
"This might be a stupid question, but talking to guys online/in dating apps it’s something I wonder. I know a lot of people are self conscious & might assume I’m being superficial & I don’t want to offend them. It doesn’t play a factor in if I’m interested in them but I will picture myself with the person throughout the day and I want to really be able to imagine would it would be like to lay/stand next to them, or to hug them. 
 The last guy I met with I truly thought he’d be much shorter than me from pictures but he was actually way taller and it was a bit intimidating being caught off guard lol. 


Edit: I will like him if he is short (like I imagine), I will like him if he is tall. I do not have a preference. Please stop trying to tell me what ~I~ like.  What's a good way to tell you you're being superficial without outright saying that you are? [Hurtful]"
"My ‘31M’ boyfriend of 12 years is threatening to leave me ‘30 F’ if I buy a house of my own. He built a house for “us” on a 5 acre ranch. As kids I’d always tell him that it was my dream to have a ranch and he says that that’s why he built it. The house is almost done but it’s still in an unlivable condition. Since then we’ve stayed in his camper there on the property and he’s asked me to leave multiple times threatening to call the police on me for no reason just because he’s upset and doesn’t want to deal with me or my dog when it’s too hot. Because he’s done this to me multiple times and we need a place to live momentarily that has electricity I’ve considered buying a house instead of renting again. Because of this he’s threatening to leave me and has told me that he especially will if I continue to get too fat when I weight 130 lbs. and am 5’2 1/2. People say I look skinny. I am terrified of him leaving me when I’m older when I really don’t have a house to live at or when I truly can’t afford to buy one later on down the line when prices are even higher. 

Am I being unrealistic and selfish? He says I have this fake feministic way of thinking that the government tricked women into believing. He doesn’t want to marry me because he doesn’t want the government involved in our relationship. When I mention a prenup he says he doesn’t want to do that either because men always end up getting their assets taken away. I asked him to go half and half on payments and he doesn’t want that and I also asked him to put my name on his house deed that way I don’t risk him kicking me out randomly but he always says no. Instead he suggests I get a mortgage loan under my name to buy off his property off of him that way he can get more money to finish building the house and that way the loan is under my name. 

What would you do?
He says that if he was going to leave me, he would’ve already left me a long time ago because we’ve been together for so many years and he hasn’t yet. 

At the same time my parent’s own a house and I’m pretty sure they’d give it to me if something bad was to ever happen to them so maybe I can have that to fall back on. He’s abusive. You need to run, and get help. Your marriage to him will end in shambles if you do get married. Get out of there. Call the national abuse hotline and explain that story to them and they will tell you the same [Practical Advice]"
"i don’t have anyone else to go to, please be kind as i’m hurting a lot. 

FYI he’s a very straightforward, blunt, and honest man. please don’t tell me he’s playing me, cheating, or there’s another girl. it’s not like that all, and i’m very sure he’s in love with me and cares about me. it’s just that he’s had very very bad experiences in the past, and in the beginning of our relationship it was quite rocky but we got through it. 

long story short, i snapped at him for the first time, got angry. i understood i shouldn’t have, but he overreacted.

he ignored me for 6 hours that day, then proceeded to tell me we’ll talk tomorrow about it. i got really upset, and tried to communicate with him. but he shut me out, and went to sleep. 

the next morning, he broke up with me over text, which is not like him AT ALL. i then tried to communicate with him, but he kept shutting me out until eventually he blocked me for 10 minutes, then unblocked me and said “let’s call tonight, but we’re not getting back together, just for what it’s worth. i’m sorry i didn’t communicate with you properly”

i agreed to the call. but we ended up never calling. i sent him a long text, being as mature and honest as possible.

the next day he apologized for his immature behavior, and agreed to my suggestion of going on a 3 week break rather than breaking up to clear our minds, however he told me that he thinks he’s not ready for a relationship and will use this time to think about it seriously. 

it’s been a few days. and i’m thinking of texting him because i think a 3 week break over this matter isn’t the right choice. i really wanna worn things out with him and i wanna fix everything.  he’s backed out before but he came back.

now i’m wondering, what should i do? continue this 3 week break? text him in a week? i don’t understand i’m confused and hurt and i don’t want to give up on him. 

TLDR; Bf got trauma triggered after me getting angry at him for the first time, now he’s suddenly backed out of the relationship.  Probably wants to hook up with someone else and is using this excuse as the opportunity. That way if you find out, you both were on a break. It really doesn’t ever make sense to take a break from each other while still remaining faithful. It would make more sense for him to just ask for some space without actually taking a break from the relationship. [Commentator's opinion]"
"
I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for about a year, and was friends with her for a couple years before that too. Things have been generally very good until recently. When she asked me if I watch porn, my answer was yes. There was never any boundary set where either of us couldn't watch porn in our relationship, but she doesn't and assumed I didn't either. She was very hurt by my answer and said it made her feel like she wasn't good enough, but I really just use porn casually once or twice a week. It's not about comparing her to any other women from my perspective, but I also understand her point of view. I feel really bad about saying this but the weight she has put on since we started dating has really made me much less attracted to her, but I only noticed that once she threatened to break up with me unless I stopped watching porn. Everything was fine until then, when she didn't know I was watching porn I was completely satisfied sexually and she wasn't hurt. In all other ways she is very good to me and we really get along. She has a great sense of humor and is great to be around, but I feel that my physical attraction to her might just not be there anymore. I feel like a total pig actually saying this but also attraction is one of the basic foundations of a relationship. I'm not happy where we are right now and something needs to change or there's no point in commiting any further. Do I have to confront her about her weight? I don't think it's right to make her change just because of me, because she is who she is and we just might not be the right match. Just writing this has made everything much clearer, but what do you even say to someone in this situation? I don't want to hurt her.  How do you just notice her weight and loose attraction when you have to stop watching porn? If you’re not attracted to someone you just tell them. But you made a mess of the situation by “suddenly” realizing your lack of attraction when she found out you watch porn. [Commentator's opinion]"
"So we have been dating a little over 6 months and because of our jobs we don’t see each other very often. She has mainly guy friends and we have been getting in arguments over her wanting to go and stay in Airbnbs with 3 other guys over the weekend. I am uncomfortable with this even though I fully trust her but one of the dudes previously liked her and another borderline sexually harassed her before (so mush so that her work place is aware of it) and she agrees not to go but will wake the weekend after the next and it’s been like this a couple weeks now and idk what to do. I feel like I’m cutting her off from friends but at the same time it makes me uncomfortable. This is just one of the issues that we’ve been having and I just wanted opinions on it A girl wanting to go stay in an Airbnb with 3 other men (you do not mention other girls) in which everyone knows that one of the men liked her and the other ""borderline"" sexually harassed her to the point that her employer is aware . . . makes literally no sense at all.  There is nothing about this scenario that makes sense, sounds good, and if this is just one of the issues you are having, I am not even sure why you are dating.

There is nothing wrong with having male friends, but to hang out with a guy that harassed her and another one she knows liked her is beyond bizarre. [Commentator's opinion]"
"So I (21F) have been in a relationship for a couple of months but it was not it for me, I felt nothing, just hurt by his (21M) actions (or lack of them) and I communicated it to him and he said he won't change so I broke up with him. Now I'm trying to date, but the thing is that I literally feel nothing. I want to feel, but it's not there. Guys tell me I'm so nice and funny and then make jokes that make me feel inferior and it's all gone, I try to tell them that it is an issue for me and they tell me something like (it's just a joke) but it's not. Those things get to me, I've been told my whole life that I'm not enough or will never amount to anything. I am in therapy, doing my best and it's still not enough to be talked to like I'm an equal and not someone stupid. Like, am I smiling too much? Do I look like I'm stupid or act like it? It's just exhausting, I don't know what to do. Am I supposed to just wait? Am I the problem?   I used to feel the same way. Like I just kept meeting girls who I thought were attractive, but they didn’t meet any normal standards. And I thought it was just me that was the problem. But then I met my current girlfriend, and I’m telling you that you can be in a good relationship, you just never have to stop searching for it.  [Emotional Support]"
"So my girlfriend and I have been dating for about 9 months and I'm not sure how to tell her I get frustrated at some of the questions she asks me because my emotions are not complex enough to handle them. For example: Sometimes she will ask me how I am feeling or what I am thinking about. I didn't have a problem answering in the past but over the course of our relationship I've learned that certain answers will trigger follow up questions that I was not prepared to answer or have no desire to answer - especially if there was a specific thing recently affecting me.
She will ask ""How are you feeling?"" and if I answer ""I'm feeling pretty good."" Her follow-up response/question would be ""Even though your stomach was hurting earlier?"". A question like that will take me away from the current, positive feeling I have and bring me back to how I was feeling when my stomach was upset. After that, I feel my emotions are too simple to take me back to where I was after being reminded of a negative experience and I am left with a feeling of frustration towards my girlfriend for that being a follow up question.

I'm not sure how to address with her without making her feel she shouldn't ask me questions or get to know me. Any advice on how to bring it up to her or ways I cannot be so affected by her questions? She isn't sensitive in general but she is more sensitive to the things I say and how I say them.

"aka he's cheating but only the girl finishes and he did not? is that even realistically speaking, possible? or he's lying? but why would he lie about something like that? He already admitted that he cheated on me, why tell me that detail? And another thing, when we were still getting to know each other, he told me that his first ex cheated on him multiple times during their long-term rs so this made me wonder the fuck out, IF U ALREADY EXPERIENCED BEING CHEATED ON, WHY WOULD U DO IT TO UR PARTNER IF U SAID U ALREADY KNOW THE FEELING OF IT AND ITS NOT GOOD???
He also told me when he admitted that he cheated the day after he had done the deed that if he was on my shoes, he would immediately leave me and i told him ""well the thing is, ITS NOT U WHO GOT CHEATED ON SO U DONT GET TO QUESTION HOW I WILL HANDLE MY BUSINESS OF GETTING CHEATED ON"" sorry for the capital letters, noni did not yell at him, i just want to emphasize it so that it gets through his closed minded head at the time. Like why would u compare ur experience with mine when we are not the same person, every person is different so do not assume that if something happens and ur action works with it, it doesn't mean that it will work with mine. And call me all u want y'all but I was willing to talk things between us, I was willing to hear him out and make him do the consequences of his actions but he said he will choose to distance himself from me because I do not deserve something horrible like him, who cheated on me. Oops, kinda got sidetracked but any inputs about my question and our situation, everyone? I will appreciate it! It doesn't even matter.

"Got tested a couple of months ago after returning from South Africa, per a promise to my partner then . She and I are on good terms but are no longer dating. My test was clean. Fyi I have been polyamorous for years now.

Since returning, I have had sex with her and 3 other people, 2 new. With one of these people, the condom slipped at the end. I told her I was fine with being tested, which she liked, and I feel is the right thing to do.

She has since mostly vanished, just exhibiting breadcruming. I understand she has a life and that despite really connecting, that doesn't mean a fling necessitates more from either party. She is not responding to texts or asking for me to get tested, so I've moved along in life whilst enjoying a good memory.

I get tested annually, at least, and am not worried. But out of respect for her, I am fine with getting tested. FYI I have had a vasectomy so that isn't a concern.

Tldr; for someone who has clearly moved along and is not keeping in touch, should I get tested after a condom briefly slipped? FYI this is one of those condom slipped off while pulling out after orgasm, not mid-sex.

Please, I've had a tough month so save any aggressive comments for elsewhere. I'm trying to do the right thing. Yes get tested [Practical Advice]"

"This is so stupid compared to all the other posts in here but I just genuinely don’t know what to do. 

For context, we were in a 8 month talking stage & he asked me out right before my girls trip to DR in March, however we made it clear that we were only talking to each other prior to dating. 

In January, I found out he was messaging this girl he had a previous fling with last year. I asked him about it and he said he was just asking her to get his speaker back. Then I dropped it. 

My boyfriend is a well known guy in our city, & he’s attractive. He gets a lot of attention from other girls, he follows some attractive girls, but I never cared because he gave me a sense of stability. I don’t care when he goes out with his friends, simply because I trust him, but now I don’t. 

Recently I saw screenshots of the conversation (friend showed me), he was asking to see her, was saying she’s looking good- basically pursuing her. 

We had a conversation about it, he apologized about it. I felt stable in my relationship with him up until this point, I hate being lied to. He said he didn’t hang out w her, then said he went to pick up his speaker & she just gave it to him while he was in his car- but I kind of don’t really believe that at all

I know we weren’t dating, but exclusivity was established by this time. Even though it happened in the past, I don’t know how to bring it up with him & get the truth out. I feel like he may be lying, but I don’t want to continue badgering him about this if he is telling the truth. 

I know this is so stupid, I just feel so overwhelmed so I turned to reddit for help lol  [deleted] [Not Relevant]"
"I am looking to getting to really fix my dating life. However, the major essence of this is not to be in a committed relationship but to be a fuck boy or a player. I dont have a lot of experience so I want to build that up before actually deciding to commit or get married. Been working on myself constantly for the past year. I moved countries. Got a high paying job and lost weight. I was 120kg but i weigh 95 now. I dont have abs yet but I should probably start seeing them by year end. I was only doing cardio cause I was broke and had no money to pay for a gym but I can now afford to pay for a gym so I am joining one and I am going to be consistent.

However, I dont want to wait till I get abs to really fix my dating. I have only had one gf and not much experience and I am bald and black and I am wondering if its possible to achieve what I want. I am also over 6 feet tool if that helps. I was also thinking getting tattoos and piercings if they would help but the fact I am bald and I cant get those nice black guys haircut or dreads or the black panther villain guy haircut tells me it might be a waste.

How can I genuinely do this. I dont mind dedicating 6 months to a year to achieve this. I am a patient man. Lmfao what the actual fuck. You need advice on how to be a terrible guy to women? You want people to tell you how to lure women in so you can play them?

This is the lamest post I’ve read so far. Yet you think the problem is being bald and black? 😭😭😭 [Hurtful]"
"We have been dating for a year. I went to visit him last week before he moved back to his parents’ house from college. He was affectionate and gave me advice on an argument I had with my family. 

Then he didn’t respond for days and I panicked because I thought he was depressed and blocking me out or mad at me. He later told me his phone was acting up and he didn’t receive my messages. What’s more, he made a new instagram account and was posting there and adding people while he wasn’t in contact with me. It left a bad taste in my mouth because I thought he was ghosting me and he always told me how much he hated people showing off on social media. He explained that he just wanted to share his hobbies and life with others. 

I expected things to go back to normal after that. But since he moved back a few days ago, he’s been even worse at responding. One word responses without the pet names, emotes or punctuation he usually uses. I told him he sounded cold and asked if he could tell me he missed me and loved me like usual (because he wasn’t saying it back) and he barely responded and said he’s been out of it recently. It feels like I’m pulling teeth talking to him, and yet he’s more active on all his social media platforms than ever.

Maybe he just needs time to recharge, so should I just stop bothering him with texts for a bit? It upset me because if I’m active online but wanting to work on something I’ll tell him “hey, i’m going to work on this” instead of replying one word and leaving him hanging. I would like to think he’s just going through it or busy and overwhelmed right now, but any text conversation with him (can’t get him to call for the life of me) reinforces his reluctance to express any affection. I wish he would open up to me like he said he could if he is stressed out or something. Right now it just seems like everything I say is bothering him. 



 It seems like he's trying to step back from the relationship and ""quiet quit"" you. I suggest you call him, not text, or go see him.  Talk to him.  Find out what's going on and if he still wants to be with you because he's wasting your time. You can do better. [Practical Advice]"
"I (F24) don't know what to do with dating. I've been single my entire life and I haven't had sex or kissed anyone ever. I know I am sexually attracted to men and women, I think I am mostly physically attracted to men but romantically to women. This makes it very hard for me to know what's best for me. I don't feel comfortable with having sex before a few months of dating. I am scared that when I start dating one gender over the other I will feel in doubt all the time because I haven't experienced the other gender.

Seems pretty normal to have a low success rate on dating apps as a guy.  Very few people unless they are breathtakingly attractive get anything out of it so it’s nothing to be alarmed at.  I think even off apps it can be challenging although there is more opportunities to bond with people.  But I’ve struggled yeah. [Commentator's opinion]"
"We've been together for a year almost, more often than not I always initiate. We see each other 2-3 times a week, but mainly to do sports or activities, maybe once we will stay over in each other place and most of the time I'm the one engaging sex?

I have mentioned this to him and he understands my frustration he says, he says he likes me a lot, and he fancies me, says I'm good looking/attractive and fit, so physical appearance should not be an issue, I'm his type?

Now he keeps telling me that he has low libido, yet he watches porn everyday, he sex talks a lot and online is more ""playful"" than me.

For example, last wednesday he stayed over at mine, and I initiated and we had sex (last time had been over a week), then on friday we met again and he stayed over, I tried to initiate (again) and he said he was too tired, even to cuddle or kiss, in which I understood, people have those moments. So in the morning I tried to be fun and started caressing him and see his mood, and he was like ""I haven't brushed my teeth"", ""I want to sleep"" this was at 10:00 am.

I'm getting to a point where I'm not sure anymore, I'm trying to abstain from bad thoughts, I really like this guy but I'm starting to feel like a needy person when I'm with him? It's getting to a point I'm not wanting to initiate anymore and if I do it just means we will have less sex. Next time I'm seeing him will be this friday and I know that more than likely we will have because he asked for me to stay over, but I feel so frustrated that I feel like going, staying but just not do anything, but that's not a healthy approach or thought...

TDLR : I feel like I'm being needy, I communicate as much as I can with my partner but I'm just feeling like shit and the only one that cares about this... Move on, not a good match. [Practical Advice]"

I'm unsure if he actually wants to be friends and keep texting or if he's actually into me? This has just never happened before. 

Like one time via dm- a guy was like I manifest you everyday and I blocked him. haha like do not manifest me into your life!

"M29 and f28 meet on dating app nearly two months ago. Instant hit it off and she even stayed at my house for nearly a week once. Hiking, bars, grilling, nature, etc etc all fun activities and such.

Im renovating a house and want to get it done before summer is over. I also want to hang out with the boys, we exchange actual skills and knowledge like carpentry, construction, electrical etc. 

Just so happened (m&f) we  didn't meet for like a week partly due to us living 2.5 hrs apart and because I had a friend stay over for 5 days to help with the house work. Morning to night honest work.

Anyway, was talking to girl, she first hung out with some ""girl"" she says who had a bmw m6 and met at the vet when her cat had to be looked at. Then a few days after she met up with some guy nearly 2 hrs from her to go eat steak and lobster at a restaurant. She said ""I was really hungry and had no money but I swear I left immediately after we finished eating"". Keep in mind I personally cut communication with other women during  our time of dating. She's entertaining God knows how many other people, that's just two cases she told me about, And I insinctively knew something was up when she said she was going to ""x neighborhood"" without saying why exactly (initially). All this she while simultaneously claiming to love me and be obsessed with me.

 Anyway bros (and ladies), I'm too old for childish bs and unrealistic demands for attention. Your thoughts are appreciated, thanks. its evident that she is fishing for the best choice, just play along like before and use her just for sex and fun time, but from now on dont pay for her. If she can do it then you can as well. But never commit to her just use her as fwb [Practical Advice]"
"I (23NB) met my now girlfriend (22F) about a year ago. We took a community college summer class together and became very fast friends. There was obviously an instant attraction as well, which we discussed, but she told me she was working on her mental health and wasn't ready to be in a relationship at the moment. I was relieved because I was in a similar situation. We stayed friends for about 6 weeks before she told me she didn't want to wait anymore and that she wanted to pursue a relationship with me. Stupidly, I said yes. The first few months of our relationship were great, I truly fell in love with her. However, as it continued it became glaringly obvious how much we both really were not ready to be in a relationship. I am currently working very hard to improve my mental health, but my girlfriend doesn't seem nearly as interested in recovery as before. She keeps insisting that she'll start going to therapy regularly, looking for a job, etc. but she never does. She spends all of her time hanging out with me/trying to hang out with me or binging TV shows. I genuinely don't think this relationship is good for her, however, she frequently expresses how much our relationship has helped her, and how she knows she'll be okay as long as we're together. I know this all could have been avoided if I hadn't agreed to a relationship with her, and instead continued to be her friend. I don't want to cut contact with her, because I really do love her, but I don't know if I can stay in this relationship anymore and I feel like this will break her. What should I do?

TLDR; I rushed into a relationship with my girlfriend and now I don't feel like I can break up with her.  >how much our relationship has helped her, and how she knows she'll be okay as long as we're together

Oh no - this is just pre-guilting you so you won't break up with her. [Commentator's opinion]"

"Hi I need your help.  
3 months ago I (33F) met someone with whom I want to be(34M). Everyone around says we're a perfect couple destine to be together. Our relationship has been fantastic. We love spending time together and having fun, find each other super attractive, and care for and support one another. He even asked for my picture to keep in his wallet and introduced me to his important friends and family.

However, there's a problem. Yesterday, he told me he only sometimes feels butterflies for me. He doesn't want to break up but also can't see us together because of the missing butterflies. He said everything else is wonderful—we're amazing together, he misses me, and he longs to see me often. All the bases of our relationship are solid except for that emotional spark. He blames himself, saying he's broken and it's not my fault. He wanted me to come up with a solution, but I have none.

I'm awful at love games... I'm good at flirting and the pre-couple stage, but when I'm in a relationship, I don't know how to keep things going. I care deeply about the other person and am probably too straightforward, showing all my cards.

He also told me that, in his opinion, I have two options: we either become friends or I break up with him. But when I suggested breaking up, he didn't want it, which left me confused. He couldn't understand how I could just leave him after three months together, and I got even more puzzled. He asked me what I feel towards him and what are my future plans. After hearing all the things, I got blocked and couldn't admit he's dear to me. I only respond I cares about him, he's important and that I would like to have family as he know, but I don't know if I would have a chance, because such important decision also depends on the partner and I don't know if the other side would like to have kids.

Today he texted to me, that he wants me to remember I'm important to him. He asked how do I feel and ask if he can do anything to make me feel better.

This message upset me a lot, because only what I want it's him. But as he said, he cannot be with me without butterflies....on the other hand he doesn't want to break-up because what is between us means a lot to him and he cares about me.  
I don't know what to answer... I don't know how repair this situation... Imma be honest. All of this strikes me as terribly manipulative behavior. It has all the hallmarks if keeping someone on the fishing line until they are ready to commit. He probably does ‘love’ you on some level and in some shape or form. But this man, if you stay with him will most likely cause irreparable damage to your mental health. And to be fair you should tell him that the way he talks to you feels manipulative. 2 things can happen. He’ll either accept that and see the error of his manner and choice in communication or he is going to blow up in 1 of 2 ways; love bombing you or guilt tripping you. Both of these would indicate traits common in both narcissists and sociopaths cause they can only really emulate love and not feel it. It can also be a response of someone incredibly dumb and incoherent in his head but I doubt that’s the case. But you should confront him on that for sure. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I've been dating this girl for 3 months now. She's always been my all time crush/type. We have different lifestyles; she enjoys parting and drinking which I don't. She’s passionate about everything. Last week, her period came 11 days early, which is unusual for her. I suspect she might have taken Plan B (the morning-after pill) because her cycle has always been regular. This made me worried since we didn't mess but all she did was take a pregnancy test. It's shaken my trust. I'm tempted to check her phone something I know I’ll find the truth. when we are together she doesn't pick up  some calls something that I'm suspicious about. You’ll suggest I have a deep conversation with her but it will lead to her gaslighting me. However, I'm ready to face the reality (requesting her phone), whatever it may be. Wow, you are a man baby. Even the most regular of periods can have the odd week off. Which doesn’t matter because why the fuck are you tracking her cycle (???) to see if she’s cheating on you (??????). This is a whole other level of insecurity.

Also, have you heard of scam calls? I personally get them like 3 times a day and it would be tough if my boyfriend suspected that every one of those is some guy I’m talking to.

I’m not saying that she’s not cheating on you, the truth is there is just no evidence that she is. To assume otherwise is just silly. I don’t think you are ready to be in a relationship. These are pretty clear signs of trust issues. [Hurtful]"
"

So basically, I (16M) just got a gf, I am super in love and I think its working. When the summer ends and school starts the daughter of my parents’ friends from the other side of the country will come to live with us for the whole school year. She is a year older and I have zero interest, I agreed to this about 8 months ago and I didn’t have a gf. I need to tell my gf asap and I don’t know how and I don’t know if its gonna be a big deal. I might be the issue here but I feel like if a guy that I didn’t know came to live with her for a full year i’d be super uncomfortable. Idk. Need help. I told my parents and they could not care less.
 Honestly i completely understand your concern! but none of this is your fault at all, the best advice i can give you is just be honest to your girlfriend as this is a family friend coming over, not a random girl. Hope it goes well! [Emotional Support]"
"Went on a really random tinder date while out of town. Completely last minute, but actually had a great time! Went to her house, did a puzzle together, talked about some deep topics, actually had a lot in common. Super cute and sweet girl. Ended with cuddling and making out while watching a movie together. Didn't sleep with her, but we were deff into eachother (attleast in the moment). Texted her the next day saying I had a great time, she responded saying same, nice meeting you, with a smiley.  Texted her the next day, no answer, so I decided to just give her some space. I didn't have her # but I did still have her address. Felt ambitious so I just said fuck it and ordered her another puzzle delivered to her house,  with a hint of who it was from without giving my name, kind of an Inside joke lol. Is that creepy? It got to her house yestueday and still haven't heard from her. Only reason I even bothered is because  this was the first date I've been on in a while that I actually felt that I liked the person afterward. One thought is that maybe she was turned off that I'm not in the same city as her? No idea. I'm sure the move I made was unorthodox, but is it creepy? Thoughts? 

If it matters, we're both around 30 y/o, single never married, no kids, live alone 36 F and I think it’s super thoughtful! That would only be creepy if you didn’t have a date, btw. [Commentator's opinion]"
"A few days ago, I met this girl IRL. We only knew each other by sight, as she's friends with some of my friends and came along with them to hang out. We ended up having a normal, friendly chat that night. A few hours after we parted ways, she sent me a follow request on Instagram. I accepted and followed her back. I know people following each other on social media after meeting is normal, but I had a feeling something was coming... I was right.

The next day, she sent me a DM. She wanted to share something related to our conversation from the night before and wanted my opinion on it. She had a video to share, but it was too long to send on Instagram, so she asked for my number to send it (I knew this was the “perfect setup” for her to talk to me more). Now, this would have been fine if I had any real interest in her, but I don't. I hate giving false hopes and feeding conversations with girls I'm not interested in (relationship-wise). I know some guys like the attention, but I genuinely hate playing with someone's feelings and emotions, so I always avoid stretching conversations for too long.

Well, we ended up texting a bit that day because I wanted to help her out and be nice. But the conversation dragged on, and I got the feeling she was interested in me, even though neither of us flirted or she said anything explicit that said so. I waited for it to become a bit “dry” and stopped responding. She texted me again the next day. We talked a bit, and when the conversation was winding down, she left me with a “tell me more about you.” At that moment, I knew I was in trouble and didn't know what to do. I didn't want to ghost her or be rude, so I kept the conversation going one more time.

Like I said, this isn't the first time I've been in a situation where I feel ""trapped"" in a conversation with a girl. Usually, they give up when the convo becomes ""dead,"" but once, I gave too much attention and the girl ended up getting hurt. I don't want that to happen again. 

Almost a week has passed since we first met, and she keeps texting me, even when I don't respond for almost a full day or leave dry messages. She's not annoying, and the topics she brings up aren't boring or forced. I enjoy talking to her and she is genuinely a nice person, but I don't want her to develop strong feelings for me. Maybe she just wants a friend and I don´t mind being friends with her, but that's it.

Please, help me. How do I get out of a situation like this? tell her you are not interested in her romantically, or you are not looking for a relationship now or tell her you have a girlfriend and fake having one [Practical Advice]"
"For context, I am very understanding about mental health. I have had my fair share of depression and anxiety in my past and have been very supportive about his struggles our whole relationship. 
We have been together for 6 years and he was struggling with his depression from the start (well since he was a teenager but I knew when we got together). I love him with all my heart and can’t wait to marry him, but his mental health never seems to improve and I’m struggling to mentally support him all the time. 
We have countless conversations about him seeking help and changing his medication (he has sought help on and off for years) and how it effects our lives.  But it feels like we are just going in circles. He may go see a doctor or psyc but doesn’t maintain this and just stop when he feels he is okay in himself, then he goes down hill again. 
I work 7 days a week to try and pay for our upcoming wedding and do have a lot of pressures in my own life, then coming home to find him in the same spot when I left after being home all day, just leaves me to pick up everything (cleaning, cooking, bills, etc). He works long hours himself so I do understand to a point but everything seems to fall back on me-leaving me exhausted and drained everyday.
Our sex life has taken a massive hit. I have a high sex drive but also place intimacy quite highly in importance to me. He never seems to want to do anything with me and will just sleep or distract himself with other hobbies, making me very self conscious about myself. 
I understand the effects of depression on someone’s life, but now I myself am struggling with everything. 
We have big in-depth talks and he promises to help himself but we always end up back where we started. 

What do I do? Any advice? 
Thx  There's lots going on in your life, and that makes usually manageable stuff hard to deal with. Have you spoken to him about this, about getting help and continuing even when he feels better? Communication is key in any relationship, so try to keep those channels open. But at tye same time remember to take care of your self. God created the world in 6 days and on the 7th he rested. So if even God deserves a day off, so do you. Can you get a day with no work, and just look after you for 24 hours? [Practical Advice]"
"I met someone via an app (Feeld, if it matters), who seemed interesting and interested, as we maintained conversation for a number of days consecutively. One day, a couple of weeks ago, she sent an unusually terse reply inquiring as to what could account for my writing style, which I admit can be rather stilted and pedantic (I, unfortunately, have ASD, and it has been a thorn in my side socially for almost as long as I can remember). I was frank about it, and she didn't seem deterred. In fact, she suggested we call on the phone at some point, and asked for my number. I gave it to her, and she curiously seemed to go MIA. 

I sent a follow-up, to no avail, a few days later, and a few days after that a message that, politely and reasonably (in my opinion, anyway), inquired as to whether she would like to remain in contact. She replied within a day, apologizing for her taciturnity and relating that life had become unaccountably all-consuming due to her being a student. She reiterated a desire to call sometime. I acknowledged the message, and reiterated that there was no pressure, that she could reconnect when the demands upon her returned to normal. That was approximately two weeks ago.

I fear that I am being naive in supposing that she's been so swamped for so long that she could not reply even intermittently and briefly. My initial suspicion was that she was someone operating behind a false front collecting numbers for whatever purpose, but I'm now convinced I came off as undesirable and she didn't/doesn't want to directly convey this.

Anyhow, is waiting any further in vain? Thanks. This just sounds like normal female behavior to me. 

Keep fishing. If she comes back around, great. But don't hold your breath. [Practical Advice]"
"my bf and I are long distance for the time being as we go to the same area around college, but we are currently 13 hours apart timezone-wise. i really enjoy spending time together as we share the same academic interests and hobbies, we called everyday for 1-3 hours (barring things like seeing family or doing other activities/obligations of course) but now he feels the calling has been too much for his social battery. i feel a bit conflicted because i found it perfect as he makes my evenings brighter even with so much on my plate. i want to call everyday, and i enjoy it into my daily routine. i have a tendency to need things to be the same everyday, and if things dont play out as scheduled, i get so stressed. i understand this is an unhealthy habit of mine, so i try not to let that affect a relationship, but i want to be with someone that calls me everyday instead of texting me because texts (for me) aren’t a reliable source of emotional support or connection. in almost everything else, we are so compatible. but im having trouble finding the warmth or connection to him if we were to do this routine. 

 You need to understand boundaries and how to self soothe. Your whole post is about you. You want, you feel, you enjoy, you prefer. 


What. About. Him? 


I have a friend I'm really close to. I LOVE spending time with him, he's one of my favorite people. We get along like a house on fire, laugh our asses off, we can tell each other anything with no filter, we balance perfectly in that there's like 50% overlap where we may as well be the same person, but we're 25% on either side on opposite viewpoints on other things so we can challenge each other while also understanding one another. I adore every single second I spend with him. If platonic soul mates are a thing, it's this. (We're different orientations so no, nobody's into each other like that, which I think is why it's so comfortable)


I really don't think I could ever get tired of talking to him and especially right now, when I'm dealing with a major life upheaval, sometimes it's all I want to do. I understand someone making your day brighter. And that's a GOOD thing. I'm sure it makes him happy when I tell him he cheers me up and is a safe space. I'd like hearing that. 


But it's also my responsibility to do that for myself and manage my own feelings. He gets to spend time with his husband, with other friends, or alone. He gets to focus on work when he needs to. He gets to have his own struggles and rough days when he's not feeling social. It's not up to him to make sure my mood stays up. It's not up to him to fix it when I'm feeling low or anxious about what's going on. He can't anyway. He can listen and reassure me but that's literally ALL he can do. 


And if we talked all the time, what would we even have to talk ABOUT? We meet up about once a week or so (+/- as life permits) for some drinks and that we don't talk all the time is WHY it's so fun. We can catch up on the week's events and gossip and share all those ""OMG I was going to tell you about this next time I saw you!"" things. 


Your BF is trying to set a boundary and communicate HIS needs. He's not saying he hates you and never wants to speak again. He's saying he needs a better balance, and quality over quantity and that he can't be your everything. He's being reasonable. 3 hrs on the phone A DAY? Assuming he works full time that's his whole evening. 


Back off. You're smothering him.  [Commentator's opinion]"
"I (28M) matched a girl on Hinge and we hit things off. We arranged a date for a weeks time but I said let's get a brief call in before then (it's something I do as a pre-screen before I commit a whole evening to someone). We were set to have the call and she replied the night before and the morning of, then stopped messaging around 1pm - I had no inclination to think she wouldn't follow through with the call.

I'm a super busy person and value time, so not only do I not like wasting my own time but I treat other people's time with exactly the same level of respect as I do my own (just to be clear). So when it got to the evening and she never replied (even after a nudge text at 6pm) I was pretty pissed off. I had come home specifically to chat to her and cut other commitments short to accomadate her.

I ended up sending her a message the following afternoon saying roughly: 'I would have appreciated a text as I had put aside time in my evening to speak to you. This isn't the most considerate behaviour I've seen and not a cute look, you came across as someone who I thought would have better manners than this but I guess I was wrong"".

Granted it was a a slightly 'sharp' response, but I don't think it was out of pocket when I sent it. She responded saying I should be more considerate of what other's are going through and that my default reaction should be kindness..... but shouldn't her advice include taking the 5 seconds to text that they can't make time for the call? - I feel like she just wanted to gaslight me and avoid accountability.

I'm finding this behaviour more and more common, so have been feeling more inclined to call the behaviour out. Ghosting by definition is psychopathic and I'm really tired of it being an acceptable norm and genuinely want to start biting back instead of just letting things slide - people are too detached from what a scummy thing to do it really is. What are people's thoughts on sending messages like these when someone acts in these disregarding ways? I would have given her the benefit of the doubt the first time around but at the same time I can’t blame you at all. Unless if her phone broke or died she could’ve taken the time out of her day to let you know something. I think your feelings are valid here, nobody likes having their time wasted.

"I went on one date with a guy I matched with on hinge. We spoke for about a week or more before actually meeting. I thought he was a really nice person and all, but I wasn't physically attracted to him. But I would feel bad about ending it (and also don't know how to go about that because I'm soft AF and feel bad about anything and everything) because there's no red flags or reason to do so.
I feel like I'm just being shallow for not being physically attracted to him because his personality is great. 
I'm new to dating so don't quite understand the whole chemistry thing- I've been only on one date prior to this man and didn't feel anything either times. But both were nice so idk what I'm looking for.

But with the current guy I'm dating, when we message he kinda talks about 'next time', and to me it's like, you don't know if there will be a next time. Would you consider that a red flag that he low key plans for future dates? He done this before we even initially met. We agreed to meet at a park and he said something like next time we can do an activity. Idk I just don't like it but again am I being harsh?

I feel like I'm not made for dating and just want to stop with these apps, but I have no way of letting him go gently. I considered just deleting my profile, but that's so rude because he's actually a nice guy. But I also don't want to be leading him on. He's asked me out for dinner, he's a nice guy, but I'd feel bad letting him spend his money on me when I'm so unsure if I want to continue with him. Please help because I'm supposedly seeing him tonight/tomorrow and idk what to think or feel!

In summary: idk if I should stop dating simply because I'm not finding him physically attractive?  As a guy who generally tries to take rejection well. Please communicate if you aren't interested. Saves me time and heartache that I could spend looking for someone I connect with. If they become a jerk about it then block and move on [Practical Advice]"

My girlfriend and I were in a 6 years relationship, almost 7, for educational reasons some of these were ldr and we discussed this before me moving abroad.

Well last year I decided to move back to my home country to move in together with her. A few days after arriving I was looking through her phone's gallery, obligatory not spying, I was in bed she was playing something, and noticed a sexual Instagram reel recorded, at first I didn't think much about it but then I was like ""haven't seen this one"" and I confronted her about, she started making excuses, but after some talking she said she was talking with another dude on discord for a few months now, everytime she told me she was going to sleep she would just call him or whatever, not long after starting speaking with said dude they started sexting (pics included), due to the nature of the job I was applying to I couldn't focus on this issue and things continued as normal until a few months later I started resenting here, borderline hating, and I decided to break up with her, well after some talking and each one of us moving back with our parents we decided to try a psychologist alone and couple therapy where we decided to try to work on things but not meaning we will remain together 100%.


Fast forward to this week we broke up, I did, because for a few months now neither of us was happy, we were fighting a lot and things were just not working, I wasn't seeing a future with her.

My question is, did I make the right choice or not? Reasons.

Before asking, yes I was 100% faithful, didn't have much free time (working, studying and going to the gym), but all my free time was spent with her.

You can ask more questions won't add more in the post.

TL:DR girlfriend started sexting with some dude, we tried to work on our relationship for a year, but it was going nowhere so I decided to break up.

Thanks. Yep. Right choice. You don’t want to be with anyone long term who folds so easily when adversity or inconvenience shows up. You need someone who can endure because everything is not going to always be rainbows and sunshine. [Emotional Support]"
"Age gap couple… advice please

Hello, so I rarely if ever post but need some advice. 
I met a man who is 14 years my senior (28f and 42m). We started talking and absolutely hit it off about 4 months ago after knowing each other since the last 2 years under other circumstances. We currently are long distance as we met while I was traveling for work. We have spent a few weekends together, and spend every evening talking for hours and throughout the day message or have short phone calls. We just click… he says things that align with my thinking and there’s no way for him to know how I think about those topics. 
Here’s the thing, he is halfway through a divorce and has two kids. Everything regarding the situation, that he’s told me about, has checked out so far. I have not met the kids, but one is excited to meet me, the other is more hesitant. My parents don’t love the situation, and I can understand why but they also have no interest in meeting him which would help explain things I believe. I don’t think there’s anyway for them to get it… I am just slightly lost. Is it really an impossible situation? Any advice? Thank you in advance! 
 Very much do not recommend getting involved with a guy in the middle of a divorce. Think of the kids and how they feel. Their entire world is upside down and now you’re swooping in replacing their mom with their dad. Also what if they reconcile he has so much on his plate getting his kids situated and you have your parents to think of do you want to lose them over him? Plus you’re an insta mom and you’re going to have to be his caretaker in about 20 years.

"Hi, I’m a 27 year old male. I recently went on a date with a girl (25). Long story short we went on a date and we got along pretty well, at least in my opinion. We had a lot in common and had a lot of the same views. By the end of the date she says, “I’d really like to see you again” I reply with “I’d really like to see you again too”. By the time I get home, I let her know I get home and she said she hasn’t also gotten home. I thank her for going on a date with me and for letting me to get to know her. I texted her day later saying “hope she is having a great day and hope she slept well”. It’s been 2 days and has responded since. However she’s posted on Instagram. Am I getting ghosted? 

Also, before we left each other she gave me a little plushie and said, “hey hold onto this until we see each other again.”  Option A: Wait 3 more days and then ask her on a second date with plans already in mind. Don't mention Instagram or the delay in her response. Dinner, where, and when. The tone of your text will be fun, excited for whatever place you want to go with her, and happy when she accepts your date invitation.

Option B: Take a picture of the plushie riding your ceiling fan, send it to her, and tell her the plushie is out of control. If you're feeling spicy, followup quickly with a picture of the plushie surrounded by junk food wrappers and soda collapsed on a table. Express a need to return the plushie for its own good, and make dinner plans if she's laughing and intrigued.

I'd go for Option B personally, but either one is fine. [Practical Advice]"
"I was trying to date a guy.  We have 6 met times and I had told him during the second date that I was looking for a serious relationship. 

I was very clear about my intentions and he said he wanted the same but his business was a priority. He moved out of the city to a place 2 hours away. It was never clear about when we would meet next because he is busy with his business and he told me his schedule is crazy with the business in different cities. I even paid for one of our dinner dates because I didn't want money to be factor holding us back. 

We made out for a very long time on our 5th date so I would say that we have been intimate.  He has never been a great or consistent texter but I thought that's how he was 

However,  when one of our texts got sexual he was texting me almost every other day when previously it was just maybe once a week.  All texts are sexual with no definite mention of when we will meet next.  It almost felt like he just wanted to come to my place to crash, have sex and then leave.  

However,  this text really creeped me out.

He says "" I will come and get you and will take you somewhere.  Then I will take advantage of you being alone. ""

When I ask him to clarify,  he says "" basically a weekend gateway date where we would fuck and be together. ""

I don't know what someone thinks but "" taking advantage of you being alone"" sounds like a guy with bad intentions. Am I overreacting? I think he's only interested in the coochie [Commentator's opinion]"
"We've been together for 7 months. He is 5'5 and I'm 5'9. I'm eternally grateful to have him in my life and I've never cared about men's height so him being shorter than me doesn't make a difference.

Since the beginning of our relationship two of my close friends have been making rude remarks to me about our height difference. They act super nice to him but once he is gone they start saying things to me like ""You are so much bigger than him!"" (he is literally a bodybuilder), ""Kissing him must be weird'', ""Do you feel embarrassed?"", ""Do you wish he was taller?"", ""You need to be with a tall man, leave him for the shorties"" and so on. I've told them multiple times that I genuinely don't care, that none of those things are true and that I don't feel like I'm making a compromise. But they still think that deep down I suffer in silence because he isn't ""tall enough"".

These comments always feel directed at me and with the intent to make me feel bad for being taller. Yesterday at a party we were playing truth or dare and my friend asked him if he wished I was shorter. He laughed and said no but I still feel bad. This same friend used to have a crush on him before we started dating so I'm sure she isasking out of spite and not curiosity.

I started feeling a bit self-conscious about my height and like my boyfriend wouldn't want to be with me. I know it's stupid to think that way especially since he's always told me I'm perfect and all and isn't insecure about his own height. I told him about how I feel, he was nothing but supportive and said that my friends are just trying to plant the seeds of doubt. He said that it would be best to cut them off entirely from my life. I'm starting to think that he is right.

What do you guys think? How should I proceed from now on? Tell your friends to cut it. [Practical Advice]"

"We have been dating for almost 5 years. At the beginning of our relationship, I asked him to take pictures of and post the ring for sale on his eBay. He said the quality of the diamond was low and that he couldn’t sell it. He kept on saying he had it and it was safe with him every time I asked him. I didn’t care much for the ring as it came from my ex who ended up being abusive hence the reason why I divorced him. My kids were involved in the proposal and when I saw them standing there with my boyfriend while he was proposing even though I recognized the ring, I just couldn’t say no. This whole situation is making me feel kid of tricked and disappointed. This is definitely not how I wanted the next phase of the relationship to begin. I talked to him about it and he said he might get a different ring but I’m feeling almost resentful about it. How should I deal with this situation?   Who would propose to their gf with her ex’s ring? To me it would show the level of commitment he’s on if he can’t even buy me a ring. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I m 18 and going to be 19 in august 21. i m struggling with dating i m still a virgin and in highschool i had a lot of trouble dating i tried to pursue every girl in school and was rejected by all of them 🙃so i took a break from trying to date and worked on myself especially my social skills but i still have a lot of social anxiety , anyway as summer came i dowloaded tinder but it was basically useless since for 3 months i had 0 likes and obviously 0 matches should i keep trying with tinder or just ask any girl i meet in real life ?? Where did you have more success dating is it on tinder or real life ?? You should continue focusing on social skills, building a social circle and creating life experiences with them. You'll meet more women over time and have the social skills to actually talk to them [Practical Advice]"
"I have very low self esteem due to my upbringing. I have tried therapy multiple times but can’t seem to overcome it.  

This has taken a massive toll on my dating life, as I believe that I would be doing someone a disservice by having them date someone like me, when many other (and “better”) options are available to them. As a result, I haven’t dated anyone, and I am 25. I reject people because I feel like I am saving them from a bullet, yet I feel a deep sense on loneliness at my inability to allow myself to experience love.

I understand this is irrational and that relationships aren’t locked contracts that one can’t leave, but has anyone else experienced this type of fear?  Low self esteem, what exactly do YOU feel contributes to your low self esteem? Your appearance? Abilities? 🧐 [Not Relevant]"
"I'm a 23F dating a 25M for a few months. I recently discovered he didn't graduate high school, while I'm currently in college. I don't think he's dumb or lacks emotional intelligence, but I sometimes worry about our relationship's future fulfillment. I've always dated or been friends with people who are in college or have graduated. He earns around $80k a year, while I'm still in school and job hunting. He doesn't seem to mind that and is happy with me.

However, when I bring up certain topics, he often doesn't engage because he ""doesn't ever think about those things."" His family doesn't seem to think critically about certain subjects either. I try not to be condescending, but I get bored with small talk and pop culture (even with him). He will sometimes make comments like “you’re so smart” while pinching my cheeks, after I’ve said something that is common sense??

I've dated guys who are more knowledgeable, which I find attractive, but I always worried about boring them or being used. I've also rejected guys with dead-end jobs because I don't find that attractive. My ex was very patronizing and made me feel dumb all the time, so I have some trauma from that. Might be the reason why I’ve self sabotaged previous relationships? Despite this, my current boyfriend has many redeeming qualities and I am very attracted to him. I just have anxiety over this at times.

Do you find that intellectual gaps cause problems in a relationship later on? Gap in intelligence becomes more of an issue the older you get and longer the relationship lasts.

"Hi all, I'm the type of person who likes to help as much as I can with suggestions and ideas on how to make their situation easier and my bf of 9 months has an online course he's taking but he's behind because of his time management. I've noticed every time I try to help and make it easier for him to find time he will shoot down my help by saying ""I can't because reason 1"" or ""that won't work because reason 2"".  
  
I am asking what I can do because I'm starting to feel useless and dumb now. I can't recall a time where I actually was able to help him because it was shot down. I like to help in relationships because my love language to show is acts of service and making things go smoothly for my partners so they're not stressed. What can I do better or differently? I feel kinda crappy and like a bad gf.

"This is a rant post. 


So basically I (24F) talked to this cute guy (29M) everyday,everytime for 3 weeks and we had 2 dates that went really good, we kissed,hugged...

 Then he suddenly became distant during 2 days. He didnt reply at my text for 24 hours despite being online during the day so I texted him ""is everything okay?"" and he told me that he wants us to stop there because hes actually not ready for a relationship.

Now I have trust issues lol. I didnt see that coming.. he told me days before that he was excited to see me again etc.

Moreover I expected him because of his age to be more sure of what he wants and stuff. But well.. We are in a time of immaturity. Age mean nothing anymore since you have 50yo men wasting their time in online gaming. He just left because you didn't had sex yet and that's all he was interested in (since you didn't mentioned sex). Or he was just dating multiple women and choosed another one. You dodged a bullet actually as he would have probably cheated on you anyway. 

Don't bother about him and keep trying, it's hard for EVERYBODY, and it's supposed to be. [Commentator's opinion]"
"i know we’re young, we make mistakes. but there’s a lot that still isn’t morally right. 

(for some context)- me and him have been on and off for the last 7 years or so.. this has been mainly due to immaturity. he cheated on me a couple times and was unloyal during our relationship on and off growing up. however i always excused his behavior for him just being young and not knowing right from wrong. it wasn’t until i moved in 2020 and we finally ended things “for good” and went no contact for a while up until last april 2023. we rekindled and talked here and there but i finally went back to see him in october after not seeing him for three years. 

fast forward to present day.. we have been dating for the last 8 months. it was amazing at first because we were so happy to reconnect. a month into us dating, i noticed a hickey on his neck that wasn’t from me. (we are currently in long distance and have been since we got together) so you would see how this would be an issue. he played it off like it was nothing and it was a very difficult thing to look past. i went to visit him in late may, and noticed a lot of things. i am not the usual type to go through others phones as i see it as a invasion of privacy, however i felt like my gut was telling me to. 

I found a collage of nudes from girls that were old, however they were still in his phone in his camera roll. i came across a dick pic in his recently deleted, but it wasn’t ever sent to me. he still has love letters from a past fling, and has yet to dump them. he ABSOLUTELY REFUSES!! to end a SNAPCHAT STREAK with this girl that he’s “good friends” with. It felt like he would rather choose this stupid streak over my comfort in our relationship. he’s been a serial cheater in his past relationships but the delusion in me wants me to think that i am special. i don’t want to come off as insecure, or crazy but this man is rlly making me feel crazy. whenever i bring up problems to him he just lasts seems to approach it with so much aggression and anger. when i bring things up to him i just want reassurance and comfort, as well as clarity. but it just doesn’t go that way. we don’t go on date nights, and he never gets me flowers anymore :( i am just lost and drained  It sounds like he still has a cheating heart after all this time.  A good partner doesn't make you feel crazy. [Commentator's opinion]"
"So, my girlfriend and I have been together for around a year, living together for 6 months. We have, up until now, had an ""open phone policy"" where our fingerprints are stored on each others' respective phones, funnily enough being her idea. Neither of us actually check the other's phone (never, not once), but it comes in handy for Googling something or changing the music in the car when one phone is more easily accessibly than the other. A pretty good solution, actually.

Until yesterday. We were casting YouTube videos from her phone to the downstairs TV, and she went to the toilet, so I grabbed it to queue some stuff up. ""Fingerprint not recognised"". Interesting.

For some more context, my girlfriend struggles with her mental health and is currently going through a lot with trialling different medications and some work-related stuff, I've been struggling too since I've been taking the brunt of it. The last couple of months have been really rough on us both and we aren't getting along as well as we used to, even though we still love each other. There's some light at the end of the tunnel (moving soon to her hometown) but for now, it's a struggle.

Now when I think that, to remove my fingerprint from her phone, she'd have had to go into the settings, likely remove all the fingerprints she's got set up (since they're unnamed and she's not the techiest person) and then add her own back on, I get a bit concerned. Open phone policy or not, I feel a little awkward asking about it because I don't want to feel like she has to give me access to anything, even if she has access to mine. 

My mind is obviously catastrophising about this, she could just as easily be planning to get me a gift or something than she would be cheating or anything like that, but with the issues that we're going through as a couple recently I'm starting to wonder if there might be a legitimate reason to have trust issues.

Is it weird that, for the first time since we got together, the only time I want to check her phone is now she's rescinded my ability to do just that?  Yea that’s a very intentional action taken by her. If you guys are supposed to have the fingerprints set up then you just simply say to her in the least accusatory way “hey babe I think we need to reset my fingerprint on your phone. I went to change the YouTube video when we were casting it to the tv the other day and it said not recognized.” If she instantly gets defensive or even says back to you no then you have something to worry about. I wouldn’t go to worst case scenario right away but keep us posted! [Practical Advice]"
"12/31/2019: got married to wife in the US.

5/1/2024: found out wife had been cheating on me with a former friend of mine. Wife denies. We go to friend’s place 4 hrs away to check their evidence. Found solid evidence. Wife claims to be poly and cheats some more. 

5/10: Came back home together. Wife behaves repentant and agrees to stop. 

5/25: Wife locks self in room and refuses to come out, and then went on a “road trip”. Hint: more cheating. I pretend to not know.

She came back just now. I feel happy to see her and unhappy to know what she’s been up to.

"Throwaway because he knows I lurk on here. 
I (F34) have trouble trusting my boyfriend (M35) after he has cheated in a past relationship. A bit of context: About 4 years before meeting me, my boyfriend had a pretty long relationship (10+ years), which ended up with them breaking up after he realised he wasn't in love with her or happy anymore. They started dating as teenagers and had a break-up in-between, but then resumed dating, which according to him was a mistake. During the second part of the relationship he ended up cheating on her several times.

He was reluctant about telling me because he has had a relationship end after 7 months once she found out about it. I can't say I was particularly thrilled to know what about him and I've had times when I start getting paranoid and distrustful. I know the easiest way would be to break up with him, but we've been seeing each other for 3 years now and things are really nice between us. He's never given me a chance to doubt him, but I'm a bit on the anxious side and will spiral sometimes because ""cheaters will always be cheaters"". I see it is hurting him and the relationship to get constantly grilled about it. He says he was young and stupid and only thought about himself, but he has changed now and wouldn't do that to someone else and that he'd break up before ever acting on something or cheating. I want to believe him and that he's a reformed man, but I also don't want to end up feeling stupid, if he actually does cheat on me. I guess, I need some advice from people that have been in his position and have indeed changed. Is that possible? Or am I being naive? I know in the end there's no 100% guarantee he won't cheat, but I just want to hear some other perspectives. My friends all think like me. Well, you can’t hold it against him now as he hasn’t done anything wrong with your relationship, but (hope not) the time comes where he doesn’t seem “as happy” as before, you do need to be ready for the worst. “Cheaters stay cheaters” wasn’t created for nothing.

Summary of the last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/rEhmaIEG7G):

We broke up 9 months ago because he disrespected me, was emotionally abusive, lied, and pressured me for sex. He came back with a long apology and promises, and despite my hesitation, nostalgia made me give him another chance. After 2 days of talking, I felt something was off, so I made a fake Bumble account. Sadly, I found him there, flirting and claiming to be single. While messaging this fake girl, he was also sending me sweet texts.

I didn't confront him immediately. Instead, I blocked him everywhere and sent an email saying I lost interest and wished him well, without mentioning the cheating. He replied wanting to stay in touch, but that's not happening.


—-
Now to the recent event, 

He reached out again, by email, with the classic “i miss you” message.

I’ve been looking at the email and distracting myself with work, and other stuff, but i have to admit, i am in an emotional wreck. 

I genuinely feel so conflicted and horribly stressed. 

I want to move on, so badly, and i wanna let go of the thought of him as being my man, and my lover. But he keeps coming back, placing me in the situation where i am so little and out of control.

Stupid questions whirling in my mind, but finding answers to them is futile; there is no way that i am taking him back. 


Yet, this “i miss you” been lingering in my email and causing me pain, loneliness and grief.

"I moved in with my girlfriend four months ago, leaving my 10 year old dog home with my family as I felt it would be unfair to change so much of her life. Unfortunately, yesterday she passed away and I woke up to multiple texts and voicemails from my family frantically saying she was on the verge of death, hoping I'd answer so that I could be there in her final moments. I had to spend the day finding somewhere we could bring her to get her cremated and overall it was a difficult day mentally, and I'm sure it will continue to be as I grieve her passing. 

My girlfriend at the time was visiting her friends and staying the night for a handful of days so that they could Lan party an update for a game that had just come out. When I told her about my dogs passing she was sympathetic and initially said she'd make plans to come home early and have someone pick her up as she doesn't drive. During that conversation I said that it was up to her if she wanted to come home early or not and that she could stay if she wanted. I wanted her to be able to enjoy the plans she had set and although I would have wanted her home during this difficult time for me, I didn't tell her so. 

She ended up choosing to stay another 36~ hours and play the game, and her choosing that over me is making me feel awful. I told her the night she came back and her immediate reaction is to shift blame on me saying that I had tricked her by saying it was her decision and that these were plans she had made for a long time with her friends so she couldn't just bail on them. The conversation kept getting more and more aggressive so I slept on the couch instead. 

I'm just wondering where I should go from here? What you all would feel or say in my shoes, and if I'm in the wrong by not being more upfront that I would have rather had her home to console me. "" I said that it was up to her if she wanted to come home early or not and that she could stay if she wanted.""  
You're not in the wrong but you should have been upfront and expressed your need for her to be there. She's isn't in the wrong either as her plans were made well in advance but could have a done better job of being a loving supporting partner & came home and comforted you, even if it was for just a few hours.   
That said, as a pet owner, I know how hard losing a pet is & you have my condolences for your loss. Having a few sessions with a grief therapist helps as does seeking online support from other bereaved pet owners found in animal/pet loss groups.  
Were I in your shoes, I would definitely start attending couples counseling sessions w/ a focus on helping the two of you ironing out expectations & improving communication. [Practical Advice]"
"i've (20F) been seeing this guy (20M) for a month now. we've both agreed we're looking for something casual cause he's only back home for the summer and i don't think i want to be in a relationship rn. we go on the best dates! and get along pretty well and it's been great so far. he also lost his virginity to me...which i didn't mind cause i was pretty new at the game, and we've gotten better together lol. it's been great.

now i catch feelings really easy, especially when im intimate with someone, but i've been trying to remind myself it's just casual/ just a summer fling. we don't talk everyday, usually save conversation for when we're together or only text when there's something to talk about. he's a very chill guy, super layed back so i can't really tell how he feels. and i'm a bit shy to ask him.

but it's starting to feel not so casual anymore, cause the sex is amazing, and the way he holds me and treats me & and just-omg, it doesn't feel like it's ""just sex"" or ""causal"" it feels like so much more, how am i not supposed to catch feelings? & sigh... am i being delusional? like where do i go from here?

"For context, I’m an 18F from South Africa, and I went to an all girls school so I really don’t have a lot of experience with boys. 

I’m very close with my mother and grandmother and I trust their opinions. Recently though, they got on my case about the stretch marks on my thighs, hips and breasts. I got them because I didnt eat or exercise well as a child and my weight fluctuated a lot. They told me that I would feel embarrassed when I went to the beach because boys don’t find that attractive. I’ve come to terms with the marks on my thighs and hips but I’m still very self conscious about the ones on my breasts.

I’ve never kissed or dated a guy and want to know from the perspective of any guy that’s older than 16, are stretch marks something you guys pay attention to? 

And girls, should I look into like cosmetics and stuff to get rid of them or leave the marks as they are? I have personally never been turned off by stretch marks. I don't think those are a big concern for looks. I care much more about other things: Like, are you fit and healthy now? That's way more important.

Remember also that men aren't a monolith. Most won't care but some men might. You want to find a good match. It's not important that every man on the planet finds you attractive. You just need a portion of them to find you attractive. And that is quite likely. [Emotional Support]"
"Hi guys my boyfriend of 4 years confessed to me that he cheated on me on 1st year of our relationship.
He said he wants to marry but he couldn't start it without keeping this secret and he bursted out in tears.
He said he was scared because he had past bad relationship and when he was falling in love with me it scared him so he went out and had sex with someone else after that he felt disgusted and hated him and knew I was the one.
He thought keeping it secret would keep relationship safe but he couldn't keep it anymore as it was killing him.

I don't know how to feel I am confused and don't know if I even know him.He said that's the only thing he ever kept secret. The image of him with other women and named makes me sick and disgusted. Also I don't want to throw away 4 years of relationship and good memory. Reddit has taught me you either go to individual therapy and couples counseling to see if you can get over his betrayal and he can understand why he cheated, (prob get better communication skills as a bonus too) or you break up.  On the plus side, it was one time and he feels guilt. 

Also better to decide before a marriage and kids (and def have a prenup where you get more money if he cheats, or whatever the standard clause is so he is clear on the consequences of any future betrayal).  Prenups are love - you want both people to be treated fairly even if you grow apart in the marriage. If he wont consider a prenup, which is a benefit to both people, then ex. 

4 yrs out of 80yr isnt really a waste. You grew as a person in this relationship, hopefully for the better. So if it was 1 yr or 4 yr, don't let that sway what your gut tells you. Will you be able to trust he won't cheat 1 months from now, 1 year from now, 10yrs from now. And what actions can he and you take to have trust again. [Emotional Support]"

My partner (F23) of 6 months currently brags about their sex life with their ex and how they would « make her cry by fingering her so good », how many times they would have sex per day/week, and how long it would last. I (F23) can’t be fingered because or vaginismus and sometimes i force myself to ask my partner to finger me because I feel shitty and stupid compared to their ex. 
My partner never made a single comment on my vaginismus and stop when I tell them It hurts me when we try. When we have sex it is good, but then they would go talking about their ex. 

I don’t know what to do because it makes me feel like crap. It’s my first lesbian relationship.

"My (25F) boyfriend (30M) is from another country. He’s currently traveling back to his home country to go to a friend’s wedding. Our relationship is relatively new and he already had his itinerary for the trip planned, so that’s why I didn’t go with him. He also already had a date to the wedding. His friend of 8 years, we’ll call her Emily. 

Emily has tried to get with him before. Back when he got engaged to his first wife. He has since divorced the wife, and has not gone to Emily. 

For this trip, he explained to me that they were just friends and that he firmly laid out boundaries. I didn’t mind. I’m relatively secure in myself. He can have a friend date to a wedding. That doesn’t bother me. He told me that he hasn’t bragged about his new relationship to her because he doesn’t want to hurt her feelings, but she knows he’s in a relationship. 

Even still she has firmly communicated that she wants to sleep with him. 

Now he’s there and he let it slip that they are staying in the same hotel room. I didn’t know this so it blindsided me. He says he thought he told me before. Maybe but I don’t know. Apparently they each have their own bedroom and bathroom so they’re separate. 

Not only that, but they’re sharing a hotel from Saturday to Monday. I thought he had his own hotel and was just hanging out with her for hikes and then the wedding. 

I don’t know what to do with this information. I’m very attached to this relationship but it’s new. I want to trust him but not be dumb. 

He apologized to me and told me he would try to repair. Whatever I needed. I don’t know what to say to that. Originally he was avoiding calling me in front of her to spare her feelings. I told him to call me tonight from the hotel. Not blasting it in front of her face but making sure I exist. I don’t know what to do. What do I say?

Tldr - my boyfriend is on a foreign country staying in a hotel with a woman (who we know wants to sleep with him) for 3 days and I don’t know what to do.  >I want to trust him but not be dumb.

You are being kind of dumb.

He has proof that she historically wanted to sleep with him. They're going to a wedding as a ""friend date"". Sharing a hotel room and drinking.

If you consider any of that acceptable, you're setting yourself up to end up with guys like him.

This shouldn't have even been a discussion.

He should know better that sharing a hotel room with someone who wants to bang you, that's disrespectful to your relationship.

And you're eating all this up:

* He told me that he hasn’t bragged about his new relationship to her because he doesn’t want to hurt her feelings.
* Originally he was avoiding calling me in front of her to spare her feelings.

He's hiding you from her.

Why? Because the interest is there.

I would break up with anyone on the spot if they asked me to sleep in the same hotel room with a ""friend"" that wanted to bang. How brain dead can you be to think another would be remotely okay with this.

Your innocence is being taking advantage of. [Hurtful]"
"I'm (M25) about to get married to F20 and I'm kinda stressed about being able to get it up in the bedroom - we'll be losing our virginity on the wedding night.

My friend is a doctor and I told him about my stress, and asked him if Viagra was an option for me. He said just buy Viagra Connect from the pharmacy without a prescription and keep it at the bedside table for peace of mind so I know I have a ""backup option"".

So I bought a pack of 50mg Viagra Connect and tested one out just to see if it would actually work (it did).

I have two questions which made me post this to see if I can get some answers:

1. Would it be weird/off-putting to a girl if I took this Viagra connect on my wedding night? I'm planning on being completely upfront with my wife, explaining to her that I'm nervous and a medical professional recommended this to me. I don't plan on using it my entire life, just the rare ""special occasions"" like this so that I have that extra confidence boost.
2. I don't know how you're supposed to get an erection with your wife in the first place. Does she just touch my penis until it gets big and then I perform the intercourse? This always confused me because I hear people online saying they can get one just by looking at a girl, etc. - but that never happens to me. Very rarely do I get an erection by thinking of something and not touching myself.

TL;DR - I'm nervous about losing my virginity on my wedding night and don't know how intimacy works. For your number one, I'm going to be honest, if she's as ill-informed as you are about human sexuality, she may misunderstand and think you depend on the pills. I would take it because it helps your confidence and not mention it to her.

For number two, you need to focus on romance and foreplay. Recognize that at least half of women don't have an orgasm from just penis in vagina sex; they need clitoral stimulation. Focus on making her feel good; If she's not really wet, she's not ready.

Don't worry about your boner. It will be there when you need it. [Practical Advice]"

And as I was walking home from the train station she called me and she said she went to the after party for the match with her friend and didn’t realise the time. At that point she had asked if she could stay over at my house because it was almost midnight and there were no trains back to her house late at night. I didn’t feel comfortable for her to have no where to stay as it was getting late. So she ended up staying over. I’m not sure whether this is ok. I did find it a bit rude that she didn’t make an effort to come to my party but then asked to stay over at my house. I don’t know if i should just distance myself from her? 

Her grandma also passed away a few weeks ago and her family lives abroad and i took time out to take her to the airport as well as pick her up from the airport too. And also on her birthday she wanted to go away for a few days and I took time off from work to celebrate with her.  She’s very selfish. Trust your gut, she’s a taker. [Commentator's opinion]"
"Last night during dinner, my husband (40m)and I (43f) were talking about another couple in his family and their financial situation. Mostly because of my curiosity about how their situation works because the wife doesn’t have a job.

In the course of that conversation, my husband said very casually “we could replace your contribution to the family for $36,000.” He then went on to elaborate that there’s a range between about $34,000 and $39,000 that he values as my financial value to the household.

I have a six figure job.

He pays our mortgage, utilities, and all the subscriptions like the streaming networks and club memberships and annual pass stuff for the kid. 

I pay for our groceries, our kid’s daycare, and our health insurance. We each pay our own debt. Mine is in student loans. His is in business financing and personal credit cards. We each pay for one vacation per year.

I said “i don’t think that’s right. I’m the one putting money into a 401k, I pay my student loans.”

He said “sure. But those are your accounts. Both are pre-marital and I’m talking about money that benefits the family. What I’d have to replace if we didn’t have your income.”

Should I be worried about divorce?

He knows, off the top of his head, what he’d have to do to replace me and he didn’t figure taking my debt into account.

I sometimes wonder about our finances because we’ve never consolidated. We each have our own checking and savings. Our credit cards are separate, except one of my Christmas gifts was an Amex card on his account so I could get the travel perks when we’re traveling separately. About once a month he shows me his financials, usually his credit score, debts, and cash on hand. But we never talk about a budget. He’s never asked to see mine. Sometimes he will make reference to the fact that I’m over investing in my 401k and IRA because he sees them when he does our taxes.

Our marriage hasn’t been great in a while. I’m working on it and got some good advice from this community. But I’d never really thought he might surprise me with a divorce until last night.

Is it odd that he knew that number off the top of his head? Should I be worried that he’s got a plan that so easily severs me from our family?

TLDR: my husband seems to have a plan to live without me. Should I be worried he’s planning to leave?







 Do you feel able to talk to him about this? Perhaps ask him how he's feeling in the marriage, express your concern about what he said? [Practical Advice]"
"So I’ve been on two dates with this girl.


We hit it off instantly, make each other laugh heaps, share interests, and there’s undeniable chemistry. It’s really rare that I meet someone so gorgeous that I connect with so well, and so naturally I’m super into her. 

After our last date she made clear she’d be busy for the next several days. Fair enough. Up to this point, all signs were good. 

Here’s the thing. We were having a casual conversation over text after, and I asked her a pretty  casual question (how was work?). It’s been two days with no response. One part of me thinks this is no big deal, and the other is freaking out because it’s possible I’m being ghosted. 

On one hand, she did say she was busy and all other signs point to stuff being fine. 

On the other, two days is a pretty long time and she’s been viewing my instagram stories and stuff so it’s not like she’s not on her phone. 

Generally my attitude is “if they wanted to they would” but damn. I just really want to keep seeing her and I’d be so bummed if this turned out to be a ghost situation. 

What do we think? I absolutely hate double texting so I’m going to just wait and see if she replies, but I’m just not sure if this is cause for alarm. 

Cheers  Viewing Instagram stories or scrolling on your phone is passive, answering questions and texting is not. Sometimes people don't have the mental energy for a conversation and may put it off. Give it some time to see if she replies or not. [Practical Advice]"
"So I have a friend with benefits. We were friends before we hooked up. We first slept together last Sunday. We hung out all week except two days. I told him I liked him and he said he liked me too… though he said he didn’t want anything serious and was resistant. I asked him to come over yesterday and he said he was tired. That makes sense because he worked all day. I am wondering if I should see if he wants to come over tonight. Should I wait for him to text or just go ahead and text him? Girl don’t do it!!! This isn’t a friends w benefits. You already have feelings and he told you he doesn’t want anything serious, do you really want to go down the road to a situationship?? [Practical Advice]"
"Just as the title says. 

This is one of the reasons I broke up with him, but my ex boyfriend shared it with his friends after he said he wouldn’t. I asked him not too. 

The picture was focused on my chest. He was in it too. His face was showing, and his hands were covering my n*pples. You can see the rest of my chest though, and the picture was when we were having sex. 

I’m obviously hurt, and feel disrespected for disregard of my privacy, but I can’t help to feel like I’m wavering back and forth between having a perfectly valid response to a nude being shared without my consent or if I overreacted - sometimes I think to myself that “you can’t even see my n*pples, so no big deal.” 

The relationship is over, and I’m not going back, but I just need some validation that this is a huge deal breaker.  That’s super, super shitty and grounds for breakup. Any guy that that is ok violating that level of trust with their girlfriend isn’t deserving of a girlfriend. 

Also, it’s always wise, early in the relationship to state your position on these matters. As sad as that is to say. [Commentator's opinion]"
"this guy (M 20) that im talking to (F 20) told me that when he was a teenager he cheated on his girlfriend at the time. i’m not sure if i want to continue talking to him. he said he has complete remorse and that he was just a teenager, and that loyalty is one of the most important pieces in a relationship. does cheating in your teens once, mean you’ll cheat again in future adult relationships? this is why anyone who ever cheated don't ever talk about it or admit it

this is why in general guys don't open up or admit any flaws. 

where most guys will be compassionate about mistakes most girls do in the past, this doesn't seem to be the case the other way around

if someone cheated and they understand what they did was wrong and have figured out why they went that route and how a different path was better they are in a good position. 

if you don't think people ever change then why are we even talking about mental health and going to therapists to ""heal trauma"" would just be a giant waste of time. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I've been in a happy relationship with a guy for almost a year now, we've been known each other for much longer. His ex broke up with him last summer but presumably he got over her before we started dating. We did not have any problems so far, we talked about his past relationship numerous times and he made sure he is over her. I did not see any red flags or anything, he didn't mention her or anything, I didn't see him looking at her profile or so. In short, nothing concerning 

However, recently, we have been cleaning the house and he found a postcard she wrote him for his bday. He put in in the folder. I asked him if he wants to throw it away and he told me that he keeps all the letters and cards from his exes and never throws them away. However, he said he doesn't reread them, go over them etc, just does not throw them away. I know that I should not judge people by myself but if I know that I don't want to read it, why keep it? I feel kinda uncomfortable knowing that there is a folder somewhere in the box with all the romantic things his exes were writing him but I can't make him throw it away too. 

I asked him what the reason is for that and he seems like he doesn't know himself, he keeps saying ""I am doing it since high school and I don't want to change my tradition"". He compared it to not deleting the conversation with your exes, he said ""well you did not delete it, didn't you? But it is equally personal as the cards, isn't it?"" I did not know how to react, the chat does not feel the same as the love letters of course but... I dont know what to think, is it my issue or problem that I am worried about it? Should I just accept? It's totally personally opinion.  I have everything all my ex's ever gave me; it doesn't mean anything at all and I don't even look at them specifically, just come across them occasionally when looking for something else.  They have happy memories associated with them, even though the relationships have ended (which I am eternally glad about).

Unless he gives you a specific reason to be suspicious I really wouldn't worry about it. [Commentator's opinion]"
"Actually, I (F53) know the answer; I just have to cut this off. But still I have doubts. So please provide your advice with explanation.



I went on 2 dates with a man who, in theory, was a good fit for me. What are red flags for me; he (51) has never been in a relationship and I found out yesterday that he doesn't seem to have any friends either.



I also got the feeling that he was trying to pressure me to quickly schedule a new date with him after the first date by indicating that he had a date with another woman but that he wanted a second date with me first. I then said that if he wanted to date someone else, he should do so. But I don't think there was anyone else.



But the problem is mainly that he is terribly physical. Within 10 minutes of the first date he was constantly seeking physical contact. Sitting too close to me (read: sitting against me), touching my hair, shoulders, arms, sitting and things like that. And his talking mainly consisted of giving me compliments, which is also awkward. When saying goodbye he also tried to go a little further, but I was able to hold that off.



Now we went to a festival together. First he introduced me to his parents (he still lives at home) and we had a drink with them, which I thought was strange for the second date. At the party itself I was more concerned with guarding my boundaries than enjoying the music. He was constantly touching me, pulling me against him, trying to press my buttocks against his crotch, etc. Very uncomfortable. If I pushed him away, he would stay away from me for a moment and then sit next to me again. And just keep giving compliments. I was dreading the moment of saying goodbye and sure enough... he immediately pushed his tongue deep into my mouth. I abruptly pushed him away and said that he was going way too fast and that he should slow down so I can relax too. He indicated that perhaps he wanted it too much.



In retrospect I should have said something different; His behavior on both dates doesn't make me feel safe with him. The fact that I dread saying goodbye because I'm afraid he will assault or even rape me is an important sign. He can say that he accepts a No, but his behavior says otherwise.



So another question; What should I say to him in a text to make it clear to him that I don't want to date him anymore? I hope he can learn something from it. Tell him it’s not about accepting a “no” to stop but getting a “yes” to start. He’s not entitled to touch someone everywhere and anywhere because they accepted a date. [Practical Advice]"
"Sorry, this is my first post.

We've been together for 8 months now, long distance. I was diagnosed with both ADHD and ASD on December 2022. I let her know of my disorders and she seemed pretty understanding, telling me that it didn't matter. It's important to acknowledge she has BPD.

But now I feel like I'm ruining our relationship due to my disorders. The main problem is me ignoring her. Sometimes I'll just be spoken to and I won't realize, or I won't understand that I'm supposed to respond. This has been going on since we started dating.

It barely ever happens when we're alone, but when other people are present it gets way worse. I'll just forget that I'm part of the conversation unless I'm spoken to and reminded plenty of times that I'm supposed to speak.

I've tried reminding myself in a variety of ways, but it always happens again.

We've had plenty of arguments about it, I always promise I'll change but I just end up doing it again.

Today I think it's her last straw. I ignored her again because I didn't know how to respond to what she said.

I understand it triggers her a lot because of past trauma, but I really can't help it, it's beyond me.

I honestly don't understand if there's something im doing wrong. I want it to work, but I just feel like I'm ruining everything with things that I can't do anything about.

Is there any way I can stop this from happening?

tl;dr: im ruining my relationship by ignoring my partner because of my autism and i dont know how to fix it Are you on meds or anything? You should consider therapy. It’s good you’re putting in efforts to change instead of being ignorant and inconsiderate [Practical Advice]"
"So, there's this young woman in the dance class I've been taking for a few weeks. She is very nice and pretty and I really like her. The problem is, I think she's way out of my league. I'm 21 years old and still in the middle of my bachelor's degree and far from finishing it. I don't have a lot of money, I look average and I'm not particularly stable in life. The young woman, on the other hand, is 23 years old, two years older than me (I think most women don't like younger men). She is currently completing her master's degree and is otherwise very stable in life. Nevertheless, we get along well, even if we have only had purely platonic conversations so far. The conversations don't just come from me, she also often initiates conversations and asks questions. I think that means at least that she doesn't find me completely repulsive. My concern, however, is that she sees me more as a little brother than as a potential partner (I'm not only younger but also smaller than her). I've never asked a girl out before, so I'm very afraid to ask her. I'm afraid that it will come across as strange and ruin the atmosphere between us and in the course. Do I even have a chance with her or should I concentrate on myself and be stable in life before I look for a partner? The only way you will know is to ask her out.  If you want to catch fish you need to go fishing.  You have just as good a chance as anyone else.  If you don’t shoot your shot I can tell you rn your chance is zero.  

If you’re concerned about potential awkwardness wait until the last class to ask her out.  Keep it simple. Ask her if she wants to get coffee or drink after class. [Practical Advice]"
I’m (m)17 after a month of talking with her I thought she was the one she was perfect we had everything in common but she started to not text me often so I asked if she still liked me she told me I’m a good person but she doesn’t see me in her future cause she’s always busy could I still get her back if I give her time and come back?  No. She said she didn't see you in her future but it's not because she's that busy. People make time for people they care about. So she was partially honest. She doesn't see you in her future because you're not her type and she wanted to let you down as easily as possible. You need to move on even though it hurts. [Practical Advice]

I (23m) know that this topic is often discussed here. 

There is a woman in my courses, and we have exchanged a few words. I really enjoy our conversations, so I messaged her if she would like to meet up for a cup of coffee, and she agreed immediately. I haven't communicated this as a date. Would it be appropriate to give her some flowers when we meet, as a nice gesture? I don't want to rush things.

"context: my boyfriend has a problem watching porn. we've discussed this in the past. he's into some really fringe stuff that i find absolutely disturbing and disgusting. i told him it makes me uncomfortable that he's watching that kind of porn while we're together especially bc he hid it from me in the beginning. i originally he was into that stuff by accident. i found it by looking through his reddit account after he sent me post. he told me it was a fetish he used to have but went away. a few months later, i found more of that porn that was viewed recently. i was so hurt he lied to me and i was disgusted by the images i saw. it nearly ended our relationship but i said id give him another chance if he promised to not watch porn of any kind. we talked about it and concluded he may have a porn addiction. i gave him the opportunity to tell me if he was struggling with it, to tell me first and i wouldn't be mad or leave him. basically while i was grossed out by his taste, i was mainly hurt that he lied to me for months. i even asked him multiple times through the follow months how he was doing and if he was okay. he always said it was easy and he wasn't struggling at all. then yesterday we were talking and i looked through his internet history, and i found that damn subreddit in his recently viewed. i know im shitty for going threw his history but i had been burned before and my intuition was telling me something was wrong. i turned the phone towards him and asked why that was there and he instantly started denying it and begging me to stay with him. but i yelled at him and told him to give me space and shut the door on his face. i haven't spoke to kin since. i don't know what to do, ive just been cry v all day. i feel so betrayed and confused. i can't look at him the same way, i can't even think about him the same way. where do i go from here? i don't know how to forgive him or if i even want to. all trust is gone. the first time nearly broke me, i don't deserve this and i don't want to break up with him but im starting to think that the only option

"Should I tell this girl (18F) that her bf (24M) cheated on her with me (21F)?

So I (21F) was talking to this guy (24M) I was head over heels for a couple of months. As context, I had been crushing on this guy for about a year before we started talking and flirting with each other so I was really into him.  There was definitely something strange and I had an intuition that something was off, but I really liked him so I brushed it off. I found out that he had a girlfriend (18F) by accident and confronted him about this past winter. Initially he kind of brushed it off, asked what I was talking about. But eventually he kind of admitted to it and tried saying that we were only friends so it didn’t matter and pretending nothing ever happened between us. It was very strange and I didn’t really know how to feel about it. We didn’t talk for a couple months after that.


Fast forward to a couple months ago, we started talking again in a friendly matter. At this point, I didn’t really see a problem in being platonic with him, so we were just friendly. But he started to flirt again. I initially assumed (stupidly) that things between him and his gf must have fizzled out. As it turns out, he was still involved with her, but still flirts with me constantly. It’s a very strange feeling and I don’t really know what to do.

I still care about him and I don’t think he’s a terrible guy, just a bit of a player. I don’t know if I should tell the girl and send her screenshots. On one hand, I’m afraid of losing him since I really do care about him. On the other hand, I do feel bad for this girl and I think she deserves to know.

What’s the best course of action?

 This man is worth losing. He doesn’t respect you or his girlfriend. Someone who respects you shouldn’t put you in a position like this in the first place. If they did, if they respected you, they surely wouldn’t put you in this position twice. That tells you his character, & you should believe what he’s shown you. 

It’s fair to tell his girlfriend, but she’s young (& even people decades older do this) so I’d be prepared for her to A) not leave him B) blame you. [Emotional Support]"
"ok so there’s this guy at my gym who i have been crushing on for a while now. we would pretty much have the same exact workout schedule and would see each other 24/7. we would park close to each other, and make-prolonged- eye contact. so one day i finally got the courage to go up to him as we were both leaving and give him a compliment about his car (bc it was obvious he’d modified it). his response wasn’t that great. he said “oh ok thank you” not rude, not overly nice, just kinda neutral. after that i was pretty defeated. its been about a month since then and ever since he has not stopped looking at me. at first i was very harsh on myself like “omg why did i do that, there’s no way he would’ve liked me” (based off his answer) but now idk we make eye contact so much that i could be standing still, but if he’s walking his eyes are following me the whole time… he gives off a shy vibe for sure from what I’ve gathered and now looking back on our interaction, i think i caught him off guard? but also why hasn’t he came up to me, if ive already opened that door for him too… maybe i wasn’t direct enough, and is it potentially worth it to risk trying again? all in all, i feel like if he was completely repulsed by me, he wouldn’t be staring at me so much? idk i go back and forth, i just don’t want to get it wrong. You probably caught him off guard. Maybe he’s shy. This same thing kinda happened with my gym crush. I was heading inside one day as he was leaving the gym and I complemented his tattoo, because we both really like the same band and all he said was “Thank you” without smiling. Looking back, I realize that I was nervous when I said it and didn’t give him enough time to say much else. I was rushing in and as soon as I complimented him, I put my headphone back in lol.. 

You’re right. If someone wasn’t interested, they wouldn’t be looking at you or in your direction so much. Especially at the gym. If he wasn’t at least slightly interested, any time you’d look at him or in his direction, he’d be completely focused on his work out and your eyes would rarely meet [Commentator's opinion]"

I F20 and my bf M20 have been together for almost 2 years now and also have a 6 month old baby..

Before moving in together we had a good sex life (looking back now it was mainly while we were drunk on weekends), we moved in together a few months into my pregnancy and all was good. We still had regular sex up until a few weeks before the birth of our baby. Since then I would say I could count how many times we’ve done it on both hands. I constantly feel like I have to beg for it and he always has an excuse! Since moving in together I’ve had a funny feeling about something and thought he might be cheating to which he denied. 

A few weeks ago I went on his phone as I’ve never been able to shake this feeling, I look on his history of Reddit and it was 95% filled with “femboys” porn and girls with dicks! I had a look again tonight and it was filled with the same!!! I thought the first time he might be gay or bisexual but I talked myself down and told myself he must be having a joke with the boys?!… but since coming across all that again I really think he might be. How do I know for certain or am I just being nieve? How do I address this? I need help!! I don't think means gay.

I (M) am getting married and we’re waiting till marriage. 

I’ll admit my sex education is very poor, nobody ever taught me when I was a kid and I had to Google everything myself.

What I’m about to ask may sound like common sense, but please keep in mind I’m a virgin, I’ve never sexually touched a woman before, and I guess I’m worrying quite a lot about this: 

When a man is with a girl and he wants to perform PIV, how does he get an erection? 

1) I’m told by various sources that as a young man in his 20s, I should be able to get it up just by looking at a girl … I don’t think this has ever happened to me. 

2) I don’t know if this is true or not, but I heard from a lot of people that masturbating a lot causes you to condition yourself to only get erect by stroking yourself, which is why I’m not able to get one just by looking at a girl - is this true? If a woman stroking a man’s penis is normal to get him an erection, then I’d feel a lot better knowing this is how you’re supposed to get erect.

3) If I want to take Viagra as a one time confidence booster on my wedding night, then I should hide it from my wife and not let her know, since “she will be traumatised that her newly wed husband has to take medicine to get it up for her” - is this really true? I was planning on being open with my wife since I assumed communication and not hiding anything is healthy. 

Tl;dr Can I please just get an answer to the above 3 points and a comprehensive guide on how this all works and what a man and woman need to do to get the man ready for sex.



 Sex is a beautiful expression of love. I waited as well. 

It's normal to be nervous about your first time. Your fiance is also nervous as well. 

Instead of focusing so much on the mechanics of sex, focus on the meaning and why you're having sex in the first place: to make each other feel special and loved. 

If you're going to be having sex, you have to get comfortable talking about sex with your partner/spouse. 

When you do actually have sex it likely could be a bit awkward the first few times, and that's okay. Have fun. Explore. 

The best sex is had between two people who enthusiastically consent and openly communicate before, during, and after sex about what makes them feel good, how they like to be touched, what excites them, and how excited they are to please their partner. 

If you're nervous or scared, talk to her about everything and ask her how she's feeling. 

Remember, sex isn't just about PIV, getting an erection, or ejaculation. It starts way before it gets to that point. Making yourself and your partner feel stimulated, flirting, foreplay, etc. all start before you ever get to the bedroom. 

Porn is not sex, and it is not a healthy way to prepare for sex with your wife.

"I (28m) went on a date over the weekend with this guy (25m). We had a great time, chemistry was electric ect. After dinner we ended up going back to my house and watched a show I was talking about and cuddled. Throughout the night he mentioned multiple times about wanting to see each other again, wanting to cook for me, wanted me to show him one of favourite shows, things along those lines. He left, said we should catch up again soon, and I messaged after he left saying had a great time, again he said he hopes to see me soon. Said I’d love to, hoping he’d follow up with a when you free but he just liked the message and didn’t hear from him at all since.

It’s only been a day, but I’m used to almost constant convo with people I’m interested in/interested in me. He works a lot, so know he is a busy guy. When should I reach out again? Been a while since I’ve done the whole dating thing and this guy has different behaviours than previous people I’ve talked to.

"I'm (21F) generally not one of the best looking people out there. I've never get any attention when I'm out and about at all actually. Very tall and skinny. My goals in life are to become a rich cat lady. And it would be very cool to find someone I really like but I don't think that will happen in this day and age. But I know it's important to date while your young so that's what I attempt to do. So I start using the dating apps. However my dilemma is when I tell someone I know I am going on a date or I have a partner, it is almost as if it's a joke or I'm lying. And yes this could mean they could just be shocked and suprised in a good way. But when the guys I do talk to or date eventually leave for some else, maybe it's true. I feel embarrassed in way thinking after going through the process of dating. It kinda just proves the point of why are you going on dates bruh when you look like this. They are right.  Dating apps are shit. There's only weirdos and assholes on it. Find a some hobbies that make you in contact with guys. Become friends with them to enlarge your social circle until you meet someone proper. No need to mention you should maximize your appearance because I hope it's obvious.

Is it really as bad as it seems to split up when you have a kid? Can y'all share your experiences with me?

"Before you read the rest of my nonsense below- it’s all hypothetical of course it’s not like we’re actively dating and have ever discussed this ever, so how DO we discuss this?

She had not even a dust particle of reference to her child in any of her social media accounts. I ended up doing some digging last minute and figured out she has a kid. A part of me wants this date to go great.

 But worst case scenario if we like each other and want to take each other seriously, I’m worried she’ll want me to help raise her child. I legitimately cannot do that with my career goals and work schedule. I will also NEVER be a number one priority in this woman’s life until we die. It just doesn’t click. I don’t want to call the date off, but with the new anxiety I know I won’t be able to enjoy to my fullest.

Can anyone help me stop catastrophizing. This girl deserves me at my best, and someone that loves her and her child. But I’m 20 years old, I don’t know if she likes me at all and if we’ll ever end up even finishing the damn date, and me thinking like this makes me want to cancel on her, she liked me and seems stoked to hangout with me, Im just too much of a broke kid to even hand her kid a dollar. I hope you guys can see where I’m coming from, am I being unreasonable?

Another fact, I have no date experience this is my first damn date, I can’t call this off an a girl that wants ME, man this is painful. I’m mostly pissed at myself for not being able to give this girl my all regardless, fuck I wish I was rich fuck I wouldn’t even think twice  In my opinion if a single mom is dating she will expect or at least want her partner to help her raise her child, either by contributing financially or in other ways. It's understandable that you're freaked out by this because you're 20. Whether you choose to go on the date or not is up to you, but personally I would not go if it was giving you this much anxiety. You should be excited and not scared to go on a date. And to be fair the fact that she did not tell you she has a child and you had to find out yourself is kind of a red flag.

"So I have a friend that I've made it very clear from the beginning that we are just friends no sex, no dating, nothing other then friends. She has tried to seduce me on several occassions and even tho I keep telling her we will never be more then friends she refuses to accept it. 

  The reasons why I will not date her is simply because I can't have the life I want with her and I don't want to put her thru the heartbreak of dating me just for us to not work out and our friendship over. By the life I want I mean I want kids she can't have them due to being sterilized at a young age, we have none of the same hobbies and in fact she always gets mad when I'm doing my own thing and I don't answer her phone call, we have diffrent moral viewpoints on things and she always tells me I need to change my viewpoint because I'm just boring. 

She keeps getting irratated and going off on my GFs and my FWBs and then gets mad at me when i tell her she needs to stop doing that. She calls me crying because she just wants a good guy like me but it's not fair that I keep her in the friendzone. She tells me all the time that she can give me all that I want in life so how come I don't choose her. I point out all the reasons I've listed and she says that it's not fair. 

  We've never slept together only been friends. I've let her stay at my place before when she was homeless and she would be in my living room naked when I got home from work and get mad at me for not having sex with her. She would try to get in the shower with me and got angry that I wouldn't let her. She would try to get in my bed at night so I would go get a hotel room or sleep in my work truck since it has a bed on it.  

  I just don't know what to do anymore with her. It's just exhausting on top of everything else I have going on on my life right now. Any advice?? *Why do you continue to be friends with such a disrespectful ass?*  Friends are a choice that you get to make. [Commentator's opinion]"
"My ex of 9months refollowed me on instagram and we chatted. We flirted too maybe some inappropriate flirting but he started it. I would say we both broke up with each other because we argued over and over. It was because he thought he was in the right and I did too but I always heard him out and tried to see why he felt a certain way which he didn’t do with me. We’re both 26. We didn’t talk at all for most of the break up it’s been 2 months and I never bugged him but I missed him and I thought maybe him too? He ghosted me four days later. I don’t know what I did? I didn’t pressure him into anything, not even to get back together he says he’s single and he asked me if I was single too I said yes but I didn’t pry into his life so idk why he ghosted me :( he hasn’t said a word to me since. I keep myself busy with my studies, my pets, learning to play the drums, going out more with my family, calling up friends more but him doing that made me really sad Plez any guy advice would help. This is all just irrelevant blabber.


You're not in a relationship with him and he owes you nothing. You wanted an ego boost by stringing him along a bit to make yourself feel good, but he saw it and dumped you.  [Hurtful]"
"Does anyone else ever feel tired of working on your anxious attachment in dating? I have a really good life outside of dating. I have friends who I have really secure relationships with, I have a good bond with my family, I’m doing well at work, I often travel and explore new places. I’m very thankful for my life and the people in it, and dating feels like it sucks some of the happiness/ peace out of it. I always feel so much better when I take a step back because I hate how bad the anxiousness gets. I’m a lot better at regulating my feelings now, but sometimes, I get to know someone and it’s going well before they suddenly start pulling back, and by then I’m invested. So it hurts, but the anxiousness is so much worse than the pain. I know I can get over heartbreak but the way that anxiety feels? Absolutely horrible. I’ve been through therapy and I’m in a coaching programme now but it’s still hard going through the anxiety. 

I was dating for a year and a half, and I’ve stopped dating for a few weeks. Honestly, I think I’m happier now than I’ve been in months, which says a lot. I feel you and most men just see us as clingy. It’s difficult, but what I do is often challenge the thoughts I have that cause me anxiety. I’m in a great relationship where my affection/texting and attention are being met. Maybe it’s just a matter of you find someone who matches your energy and your needs [Emotional Support]"
"Hey everyone! First post on reddit for me so please be patient! I need your collective advice on a gift I can provide to my wife who's recently been going through a lot of challenging times (including personal and family related health concerns, sacrifices, anxiety attacks etc). Despite that, there's been some recent good news that have unfortunately taken a back seat due to the overwhelming other challenges (job promotion & graduation). 

  
Our living condition is currently long distance due to work, i'm looking for gift ideas I can send her remotely until we meet again. I want it to be something special and uplifting so that she doesn't feel alone or think that I don't care about her successes. 

- she doesn't like alcohol

- she likes jewelry but this would be a poor gift choice at the moment imo

-  she won't be consuming sweets or traveling due to health reasons

- assume budget is < $1000

  
Lastly, is there a preference on if i should wait until we meet in person in a couple months? I don't want her to wait that long before she feels love but i'm okay to give her a gift now and then another again when we meet.

"I matched with a girl a little more than a month ago, and we hit it off quite nicely. I asked her out for a coffee date after some light conversation and she said that she wanted to focus on her exams and that we could go out later. I tried my best to keep in touch, but not to be overly aggressive. She’s never initiated any interactions, but is always kind and enthusiastic in responses. 
Last weekend I asked her out again since I knew her exams were over, but she said that she couldn’t because she was out of town. I responded that with “No worries. Hit me up when you’re free and we can figure something out”. Yet she never did. We talked a little since that conversation, and I don’t know what to do or what to say. I don’t know how to bring it up again without looking like I’m hounding her for a date.  dont bother. she rejected you twice now and didnt bother to reach out at all the whole time. waste of time [Practical Advice]"

"A friend of mine has an OF. She asked me to help her with photos and videos, both taking them and editing them as she isn't tech savvy and doesn't have the equipment to do it or space to do it.

 I'm also currently getting into the dating world and I'm curious and concerned how much of an issue this will be for me. It's only solo stuff, I'm not involved in any way besides holding the camera. Full disclosure, we have never dated, nor had any romantic feelings between each other. We have hooked up before, but it was more of a fuck buddy type situation. No emotion besides she was in the mood. She doesn't pay me beyond either bringing lunch/dinner over or ordering it before or after the photoshoot. I've been helping her for over a year now, once or twice a month, so seeing naked isn't remotely a big deal. Outside of the times she was in the mood for more, things are very ""straight to business"" like. Almost clinical.

 I don't want to screw her by having to quit, but at the same time, I can understand this could be an issue for a lot of people and I don't want to miss out on finding someone because of it.

 So ladies of reddit, how big of a deal is this and when is the best time to bring it up with potential date? I'm not a cheater and would never consider it, but obviously me saying that means nothing to someone I just met.  You won't get one answer.  Some will mind.  Some won't.  Some won't like that you continue to see someone you've fucked once upon a time naked and in certain types of positions.  Some will ask if you can be their OF photographer.  Some will question why you're doing a 'job' but not actually getting paid.  Some will think that you're nasty, and she's even more nasty for doing what she does.  Some won't care.  Some will.  

Are you willing to stop for a future relationship who thinks it is inappropriate?  If you are, then go from there.  If you aren't, then make it known so that no time or energy is wasted. [Practical Advice]"
"My boyfriend was out with his friends the other day which an old friend came across to them and hung out for a while. He came home and let me know he invited him to his baby shower. Me and my bf share many mutuals so i know almost all of his friends. He told me that the baby shower is on 7/28, and also even mentioned the attire for this party. Which he claimed he has no idea what to wear. I felt a certain way because he didn’t even bother asking if i wanted to join him that day, and it’s not like i don’t know them. And i don’t want to bring anything up because i know he will say “He only invited me, and never mentioned to bring you” but it doesn’t hurt to ask. We’ve had many situations where he goes out and i get left behind. Goes to parties and never takes me anywhere. I don’t know i just need some advice. Should i just let it be? Or say something?

"GF 30 and me 30M, we've been together for almost 5 years. 

The first year was the sweetest. We were intimately active. We would naturally alternate who initiates the moment of intimacy. After moving in with her during the pandemic, things were slowing down but it was still fun. We were starting to shape our future; buy a house, adopt a dog. We both don't want kids. Travel

Then we moved in a bigger apartment. That was 3 years ago. We moved because the previous apartment was too small and there were a lot of ants infiltrating the out of shape building. It somewhat affected her morally. Whenever she sees an insect when we are walking outside, she freezes. The new apartment is a more recent building. We split the chores pretty much 50/50. I do dishes, clean the bathroom and outside the appartment. She does the laundry cleans the floor. We cook 50/50.

Since we moved to that apartment, I alway initiate the intimacy and she never does. For the last 2 years she started to study full time to finish university. She was doing that part time, but since I can financially support both of us, it was possible for her to go back full time.

Since she started studying full time, there's actually no intimacy at all in our relationship. She works part time over the weekend + school. So I get that she's tired. When she finished her last semester in april, I thought things might be acting up again, but it doesn't.

I already discussed about the lack of activity in our relationship. We tried to be more spontaneous, doesn't work. We tried to schedule a ""fun"" moment, when it's time, it's never the right moment.

I really love her but the lack of intimacy starts to tire me. What should I/we do next? Have you had a sit-down conversation about this? [Practical Advice]"
"Been with her for a year and a half now, the first months of our relationship were full of lies around her drug use and other things. That’s in the past now we have since traveled the world together and have ALOT of great memory’s. 

Anyhow I still have trust issues around it and it makes me act slightly controlling which isn’t fair on her.   We went on a mini break because of this last week. 

During this mini break she’s had a 30 year old man sleep in the same bed with her. She tells me he is gay but I’ve never met him and she’s only met him like 3 times. He also is asking to borrow money of her.  Just screams bad news to me!

On top of this she wasn’t going to tell me I had to find out through her messages on Facebook. 

I love this girl dearly and don’t want to leave her as we have exiting things planned. We get on so we’ll our only downfall is the trust and her lack of honesty. Is it worth giving it another go after the many many I have.  Will she just continue to be dishonest and will I find myself in the same place a year down the line.?

"Hello, so I rarely if ever post but need some advice. 
I met a man who is 14 years my senior (28f and 42m). We started talking and absolutely hit it off. We currently are long distance as we met while I was traveling for work. We have spent a few weekends together, and spend every evening talking for hours and throughout the day message or have short phone calls. We just click… he says things that align with my thinking and there’s no way for him to know how I think about those topics. 
Here’s the thing, he is halfway through a divorce and has two kids. Everything regarding the situation, that he’s told me about, has checked out so far. I have not met the kids, but one is excited to meet me, the other is more hesitant. My parents don’t love the situation, and I can understand why but they also have no interest in meeting him which would help explain things I believe. I don’t think there’s anyway for them to get it… I am just slightly lost. Is it really an impossible situation? Any advice? Thank you in advance! 
 Just remember, if it worked out, he will be 60 when you are 36 and 70 when you are 56.

"So yesterday I received a save the date for my childhood best friends (Anna) wedding. I was so excited! Only to open it and discover it is on the same exact day in October as my other close friends (Brenda) wedding, who I am a bridesmaid for. There is no way I can do both. And I definitely would not skip out on Brenda's wedding for any reason. 

I feel awful missing her wedding! Is there anything I could do instead? I don't have any extra money right now to throw her a shower or anything and I don't know who else is going. Anna and I aren't really close anymore but I will always love and support her. 

What are some ways I can tell her I can't make it to her wedding? And alternative things I could do? 

Tl;dr: childhood friend getting married same day as my other close friend. Already committed to my close friend and would rather go to her wedding anyway. How can I tell my childhood friend I can't make it and what is something I could do for her instead (that's inexpensive)? Oh no! I have already committed to be a bridesmaid in another wedding that exact day! I am soooo disappointed! What can I do to make it up to you? [Practical Advice]"
"I don’t get it either y’all.

I’ve expressed wanting to move out multiple times with good reason, and everytime the conversation got shut down by him. 

Tomorrow I’m leaving for a trip and when I get back in 2 weeks, I’m set to move out. I tried to open up a conversation with him about it last night so he had time to think and process me moving out. He couldn’t really emphasize with any of my reasons for moving out, and stated that “You (me) living with me is a boundary.”

Which it’s not? Or maybe it is? I don’t really know. Anyways, I don’t know how to navigate this when everytime I bring up the topic, he shuts down (he gave me a 2 day silent treatment once) or doesn’t listen to any of my reasons.

NOTE: I realize my post wasn’t clear. He means that in our relationship, me living with him is a boundary - or better phrased, a “requirement” - for us being together. 

I just feel like I’m having to choose between my boyfriend and what I want to do. I want to move out, but I also love my boyfriend and want to stay with him :( Boundaries are something you don't go past. Living with him is a desire of his not a boundary. The boundary might be that if you move out he breaks up but he isn't right?

 Shacking up is just something he wants that you don't believe is reasonable or healthy. You are right. [Commentator's opinion]"

"So I (27m) didn't expect to ever be in this situation, but here I am. I got out of a long relationship and recently started getting back into OLD. I had some dates that went nowhere, and a few days ago I went out with a girl that I had no expectation or intention of sleeping with on the first date at all. So much so that I didn't even bring a condom or anything since I was 100% sure nothing was going to happen (I did have some at home so we didn't do it unprotected, because I'm sure it'll come up). Our convo wasn't flirty or sexual at all, she seemed pretty shy, and even during the date there wasn't any physical contact.   
  
However, after the date we sat on a bench and ended up making out, after which she indicated she was down for more, so for some stupid reason I invited her to my place. Truth be told, I had issues performing as I guess I'm still not really over my ex. She was very understanding, and ended up sleeping over. I texted her the next day saying I had a good time and indicated I'd like to see her again, but as a few days went by I realized I'm really not ready for this, and that there was much of a spark at all. I think I just got caught up in the moment and made a dumb decision, and I've been feeling awful. I've never been in a situation where I didn't want to see the person again after having sex, and I could really use some help with how to best approach this. I'm fully aware that no matter what I'll end up looking a complete asshole, and that's totally justified, but I'd still like to be considerate in letting her know I don't plan to continue things. This was one of those situations where the ""I'm not ready for a relationship"" excuse is actually true, as evident by how bad my performance was in bed.

Anyone been in a similar situation? Any advice on what to say/not to say? I'd also love to hear from women on this, because I'm sure you've been on the receiving end and I'd like to avoid her feeling used as much as possible, though I know that's almost impossible now. Heading straight into a new relationship after a breakup rarely works out well. Take time for yourself and heal before jumping in again. No strings from the old baggage, you know. [Practical Advice]"
If you went on a couple of dates. If they removed you and unfollowed you. Is that weird and does it read as desperate? If it is an app like Instagram it wouldn’t be weird because the act of them unfollowing you doesn’t remove you as one of their followers. If you aren’t following them it would be weird because you’re going out of your way to watch them. [Commentator's opinion]
"Before instantly commenting any hate/such please read the context of the story.

Senior year of high school my good friend (we’ll call him Jack) started dating this girl (we’ll call her Kathy). During that time I got a lot closer with Jack to the point I would call him my best friend, as well as becoming good friends with Kathy as well. College comes, and Jack and I are going to the same uni while Kathy goes to community college. We remain close for ~2 years while he is still dating Kathy long distance. Later years Jack and I start to distance, both finding different fits for friends we associate with, but still hangout and such. 

Senior year of college, Jack breaks up with Kathy and puts me in that divorced parents kind of situation trying to split hanging out between the both of them. During this time I get a lot closer to to Kathy trying to help her through the break up, and we become best friends and learn that we are quite similar and compatible with each other. Both mine and Kathy’s friends/families have commented on how we would be great together and we’ve admitted to each other that we’ve thought about dating each other, I just don’t know if us pursuing a relationship is the best idea. Even if you’d be great together you should just leave it at friendship. You’d be breaking bro code by getting with her. If you’re fine with being seen as a shitty best friend and you’re cool with her having a reputation as a homie-hopper then go for it I guess. I wouldn’t risk a friendship with a good bro for a girl you might not even be dating in a few months. And above all this I think you should consider your friend’s feelings and whether or not he’d care. There’s a possibility he doesn’t care at all but would you risk that by going behind his back?

If they had been dating for only a few months or so I’d understand but they have years of history so it would look bad on you to date her. The whole dynamic of your entire friendships would change and not for the better IMO. Ask yourself how you’d feel if you were in your friend’s position. [Commentator's opinion]"
"It's almost comical what a high percentage of women go on a first date with me while sick, and then give me whatever they have by talking in my face in a loud restaurant.

The crazy thing is they think it's no big deal. They show up for the date and say stuff like i have been so sick this week, but don't worry I ""took a z-pac"" or ""I had an IV"". None if that even makes sense. They are still contagious.

"My (26F) boyfriend M (32M) has a work buddy named Vance. Earlier this week M told me about how Vance went to get a massage and at the end he got a hand job. Weird whatever good for him. Last night my boyfriend fell asleep on the couch and I was about to eat some ramen on the floor when his phone went off. Long story short I went through it (we have both done this before we have an open phone policy) I went through his messages between him and Vance and Vance texted him the address and picture of the place. Then said “Go get a tuggy tonight lol” 
M responded “lol I just might” 
Vance said “she had some soft hands”. 
And that’s was the end of that conversation. I’m 4 1/2 months pregnant with our second child. I’m seriously disgusted and so fucking hurt. I woke him up and tried talking about it calmly. And he freaked out on me saying “why are you going through my phone, you are crazy & get away from me” and went to the bedroom and fell asleep. I’ve been crying all night. I’ve only had like 3 hours of sleep. It’s 4am and he left for work. I don’t want to be with him anymore. I have no family or friends here and I’m on probation out here. I am a SAHM meaning I have nothing to my name. I could go to Arizona and live with my sister but I would never leave my son and honestly I wouldn’t want to take him away from M because most of the time he is a great dad. I know my emotions are higher than usual right now. But I’m done. We have had a lot of issues lately and I’m at the end of my rope. I’m going to call my p.o today and see what my options are if I even have any. I made a therapy appointment on Wednesday. I’m planning on telling him I don’t want to be with him anymore. My confidence is crushed and I just can’t trust him after this. Especially after he reacted when I confronted him. How hard would it have been to just say “it’s just guy talk etc”.

P.s the thing that bothers me the most is they work together. They talked about this at work. So then why did Vance send him the address and a picture of the place?  Naaaah that's not just guy talk. Suss as hell. Did he get home later than he should have from work? [Commentator's opinion]"
"Ok. Short story: I was “dating” someone. We talked about our relationships; this person was never brought up until I saw their picture pop up in the car on her phone. I stopped and immediately said I knew them; she asked… did you guys “fuck” I said yeah, uncomfortably. The rest of the car ride was chill, and I immediately regretted not saying anything. Then she told me they also had a fling and were just friends now. But it turns out they are best friends. We talked in the car, and she immediately told me she wanted to stay single and wasn’t ready to commit to anything serious. I understood that. 

 I was freaking head over heels after talking for a month and a half. I slowly distanced myself after a few hangs and told her I couldn’t shake the fact that you slept with the same person I slept with, and they're also now your best friend. She says that it’s a red flag that I felt that way. Am I the one in the wrong? How the fuck could I be. I don’t think either of us foresaw this, but it’s fucking insulting to say it’s my fault. Would you have done the same or kept trying to be friends? You mean she cut you off? [Hurtful]"
"I (22M) have been with my GF (21F) for over a year now. Everything in our relationship has been great, she’s just the best, loving, caring, incredibly cute, intelligent, for me, she’s the whole package. 

Last night we were getting intimate (it has been a long time since the last time we’ve been intimate due to her not feeling and tha situations not being appropriate), I was touching her over her pants and she seemed to enjoy it, so i asked if i could go underneath, she was hesistant at first but then said yes, I went at it but at a certain moment she told me to stop, here’s where i fucked up, I didn’t, I kept saying things like “are you sure you want me to stop?” , in the moment I thought she said beacuse my parents were home, so i did to sort of tease her and thinking that would make things spicier, she told me again and i stopped. This was out of character for me, and I recognize it, I don’t tend to break her boundaries but this time I did. We did some more stuff after I stopped touching her, and called it a night. 
The next day she commented to me that I hurt her (physically), I told her that I was really sorry, that i really didn’t mean to (which is true, I would never do anything to hurt her, she is the love of my life). She mentioned that she did told me to stop and I didn’t, which brought some memories of a past relationship she had were she was hurt in that way (way worse from what she has told me). I kept saying that I was really really sorry, that in no way I meant to disrespect her like that, that I got carried away (which is no excuse) and thought that it was because there were people in the house ( I know that no means no, that’s why i’m I frel so bad, and I’m angry at myself for not listening to her). She says that it’s fine, that she knows I didn’t mean to, that she told so that I don’t do something like this again. Even though she says this, I can’t help but feel like I lost her trust in regards of being intimate, she usually isn’t completely comfortable with these situations (she enjoys them, she like being intimate like that, but she says her past relationship may have caused some problems to her about that), I just don’t wanna be the same as the other dude. I want to gain her trust again so that she can still feel safe with me (regarding intimacy). Am i overthinking? Should I listen to her and believe that it’s fine? How can I build her trust back so that she can feel safe again (This is just something that I feel)? Once the trust is lost or broken there is no getting it back. There is always going to be that sense of insecurity and doubt.  Don't waste the next 5-10 years of your lives and just move on. [Commentator's opinion]"
"Hi everyone ! The most awkward thing and embarrassing thing happened. This is a new ""relationship"" of two months but I've known him for years since we were teens,now I'm 29F he is 32 M. Anyways we were play fighting and making jokes . He was teasing me and there was a plushy right next to me I grabbed it and playfully through it at him . Well I aimed bad and it fell on his hot tea which was right next to all his electronics ( his computer, laptop, sound system etc ). It fell all over his stuff plus on him. I literally didn't know what to do and he just got angry and rushed to his room. I started patting down the water with towels and he came with towels too and told me ""to stop I've done enough"". Then he played his laptop and the sound was all messed up . He got more angry and told me I should go . He walked me to my car and it was soo awkward and I felt so bad. I tried apologizing and he said "" I need more self control "". Well on my way home he texted me saying he can't even charge his phone. I responded to him apologizing and told him I would help him with damages. He didn't respond . The next day he liked my story on Instagram but didn't say anything . I texted him to follow up and just said I'm checking in . He gave me a dry response I responded and then he stopped . Well it's been four days since the incident and idk what to do . I feel so bad but it was an accident he was playing with me too . What should I do?

Tl,DR : I accidently dumped hot tea on boyfriends electronics and now hes not speaking to me . what to do ? Sounds like he lost interest. Advice it to move on.   [Commentator's opinion]"
"My boyfriend (23M) and I (22F) have been together, off & on, since we were 16. He's always said he's an ass guy & never been much interested in boobs but I've been wondering if he's just not attracted to mine. I'm 5'3, 115lbs, & have a nice ass but 32B/C boobs so they're like just proportional for my frame, maybe a tad small. He tells me he's attracted to them and he likes them but I feel like he just says that to not hurt my feelings. 

1. he just never grabs them, looks at them, mentions them, etc. I've walked by him topless many times & he wouldn't take a second glance
2. pretty much only showed appreciation/attraction to them when they looked bigger than usual
3. his normal compliment for them was ""they're a nice size for your body""
4. only thing he's said is a turn on for him about boobs is cleavage (something I never have) I even wore a push up bra for the first time, it didn't give me cleavage, & he didn't pay any attention to it
5. I think he got off to a girl w/ big boobs & cleavage on a show we were watching together 
6. solely watched anime as a teenager so I wonder if that shaped his preferences
7. his ex before we got back together was his first gf w/ big boobs & lost his virginity to her so I wonder if it awoken something in him

so is he fr just not much of a boob guy & im overthinking this or does it seem like he really only likes cleavage / big boobs? :/ Either way it sounds like you want him to be attracted to your boobs. I'd recommend, when appropriate, do a little strip number. Hump his leg, get some good subtle perfume on, good music, and gently beat his face up with your boobs. Some nice lingerie. If he cuddles into you, you're fine. If he pulls back, he doesn't like your boobs for some reason. [Practical Advice]"

"So my very new Bf (less than 2 months) went out to a concert with his guy friends. I knew that some of his mates were inviting their gfs to this concert, and I was a bit upset that I wasn’t even asked if I wanted to go along with him but understood why (don’t like the music and bc not the best place to first meet his mates). 

Anyway, he said he’d be a bit absent from texting, which was all good with me until he started continuously posting pictures and videos of the concert but all focused on this one particular girl that was right next to him (no one else was included, just this girl). Now I tried to hold it in to clarify with him in the morning who that was, but as more pictures of them doing selfies close together and tagging exclusively each other in posts I kind of freaked out a little on him… I called him and asked him to explain who it was. It turned out to be the girlfriend of one of his mates. He got angry at me and said I should’ve known despite the fact that I’ve never once seen, met or heard of this mate’s girlfriend. Also, the boyfriend was no where to be seen in any of these posts so I genuinely couldn’t have just known. 

I just am so upset that he was continuously posting this stuff, ignoring my message and not just giving me a heads up message to clarify who the girl was, all on top of the upset of him making it obvious that I wasn’t invited. It really felt like he left me in the dark to overthink. I’ve apologised for freaking out but he’s just been really nasty about it and I don’t know how to address my feelings properly to him? What should I be saying? Why is everyone acting like only posting pics of a girl and tagging each other isn't odd behavior.  If it was everyone sure but no. Op is justified. [Commentator's opinion]"
"This may sound ridiculous to some people, but I have just never really been good at communicating. I am not good at small, talk, or asking questions or pretty much any type of communication. This is absolutely something that I know I need to grow in.

My wife said it would mean a lot to her if I asked her more questions. For example, “how was your day Or “what were you thinking about today?”

What are some other good questions that I can ask her to take an interest in her life and show her that I care?  I think its more than just asking for asking's sake. I think she would genuinely want you to be interested as this is where it will show you care, so I would recommend taking the time to listen and ask more questions during the conversation. otherwise if you just ask 1 question then say ""thats nice"" and move on, it will be obvious you did it because you felt you needed to and you completed that goal rather than a genuine interest. 

That being said you can start with the easy classics to open up the conversation:

- How was \_\_\_\_\_? (insert whatever activity she was just doing, ie. work, lunch, your trip etc)

- Do you have any plans for the day?/What are you up to today?

- Hows your day going? 

All of these are conversation starters, the point is once she answers to then ask more and talk more. 

For Example: If you say Hows your day going, and she says GREAT, you can say, thats awesome, whats made it so great? And then she can tell you the great thing that happened or all the little good things going her way etc. 

Then just ask more questions during the conversation. 

I like to use the rule, if I dont know WHY somebody has done something, or likes something I ask them.

For Example: If she says the day has gone great because she was able to paint her nails without messing them up. You could ask what her favourite colour of nailpolish is? Why is it hard to do them without messing them up? Does she enjoy doing her nails herself or getting them done? 

You will inadvertently learn alot about someome this way, you may come to learn, shes a perfectionist and hates when theres even the smallest detail wrong, or that her absolute favourite color is blue, or that she hates glitter in things. etc. 

Hope this helps! [Practical Advice]"
"New to Reddit so sorry if this is poorly written. Also apparently these stories sometimes end up in video and stuff, so I ask that if you see this story you don't use it in any internet content, or repost it or otherwise archive it. I just want to ask this question and then most likely delete it later. Thank you.

So my problem is exactly as the post title states. We've been seeing each other pretty frequently for around a year now, and we met and were friends for a bit before that. About two months into seeing each other he told me he has IBS, and from what I've gathered since then it seems to be pretty severe. We've had to cancel a couple meet ups before because he wasn't feeling well, or to end things early for the same reason. Sometimes when we meet up he ends up having to use the bathroom due to diarrhea, and he always cleans up immediately after and is incredibly apologetic, especially when we're at my place. This is where my question comes in.

A lot of the time he's really not feeling well afterwards, and sometimes he comes out exhausted and shaking. I feel really bad that he always cleans up after himself, and I wouldn't mind doing it at least sometimes or at least helping. I don't care if it's gross, if he's not feeling well it's the least I can do. The thing that makes things way more complicated is that we're friends with benefits, not formal romantic partners (although on my end at least I've definitely been catching feelings for a while now), and I don't want to make things too weird or awkward. He also has a lot of self worth type issues and I don't want to embarrass him or make him feel like I'm belittling him somehow. I just don't want him to have to feel like he needs to clean up the bathroom himself when he's already feeling awful.

We have a generally good relationship and are really good friends, we've been there for each other through a lot by now. I don't want to mess things up, I just want to help him out with this since I genuinely wouldn't mind doing so. Any advice would really help. I think that this is incredibly sweet and mature of you, and he will appreciate you offering. BUT, he may say no (I would) for the reasons you identify and please don't push the issue, just let it go. I really think he'll appreciate you offering and just tell him why like you wrote here.

"Hello, i'm on the verge of breaking up because of this and I need urgent advice.

College students, have been dating for almost two years. He does not plan or take initiative in many things

-When he will see me next time if we are in different states etc 

- Any dates, anniversaries, occasions, i have to choose the time, the place, the reservation 

- When his family came over to see him (they live very far), their rental car broke down and they couldn't drive to us to have dinner together. He thought ""it's okay I guess"" and didn't think it was weird although I talk to his siblings often and have talked with his family before. We come from traditional backgrounds where it is customary/respectful to meet a partner's family and he did not put a care into it. I had to organize with HIS best friend to drive up to them so we can all meet.

- I am the one planning where we are subleasing for housing etc

- Says he wants to stay in my state but has not applied to a single job and he is graduating in a few months (despite him having a 3.9 and being very smart)

- ""scared"" to tell his family he wants to move out (he's 21+) to my state and has been putting it off for a year. 

On the other hand he does not have malicious intentions and is not ""playing me"". I'm his first relationship, and he is sweet in all other aspects. When we had a rough time I told him he should talk to a therapist/coach about his defensiveness and he did in fact do so (but only after I asked, again not taking initiative.)

I am tired of telling him exactly what I want him to do and feeling like i need to micromanage this relationship. I grew up in a really rough atmosphere and I sometimes just want someone to take the reigns from me but I feel like it has become impossible. I legit sat down with him and told him what has he ever taken initiative for in this relationship and it was only a game he picked out for us to play once...

His reaction when I told him all of this is coming up with a reason for everything.

Why didnt you plan xyz: i didnt know i should, it was to early, i care for you in other ways etc...

I feel like even if he does change now it is only after i poured my heart out and stressed so much to get him to change Hey there, it sounds like you've been carrying a lot of weight in your relationship. Feeling like you're always the one planning and making decisions can be exhausting, especially when you're looking for someone who takes initiative. It's great that he's sweet, but relationships thrive on mutual effort.

You've been clear about your needs, which is important. It might be worth discussing again to see if he's willing to step up without needing constant reminders. Ultimately, you deserve someone who values your time and actively participates in building a future together. Take some time to think about what's best for you. [Emotional Support]"
"So, for context I have been seeing this guy for a month or so now who I am really into (I knew him before matching him on tinder, we went to the same school and have mutuals). We have spent every weekend together and a day through the week most weeks if we have time between work commitments etc. Whenever I see him I feel like infatuated with him, he's just everything I could ever ask for in a man, loads of common interests, he's handsome as fuck, funny and the butterflies and nerves kick in more than I've ever experienced.

I am normally not one for thinking before I speak but I just don't want to mess this up or come on too strong. I know he's still on bumble/tinder etc, I am not because after a week or 2 of continuously seeing/speaking to someone that I've clicked with, I'd rather put all my time into one person not multiple. I have no idea if he's still actively speaking to anyone else, nor do I feel like it's any of my business.

But this is where my conscience kicks in and makes me wonder when the right time is to bring up like exclusivity or whether that's even what he's after? 

I'm more than happy to just see where it goes and just spend as much time with him as possible but I'm use to men and the novelty wearing off as soon as they find a better option so I guess I'm just afraid of getting more wrapped up because I'm already feeling more things that I'd want to be at this point 🙈

Any advice, similar situations or constructive criticism will be appreciated 😅 Rule of thumb is 10 dates or 3 hookups, whichever comes first.  [Emotional Support]"

"A few weeks ago, I met a friend of friends at the university. We chatted a bit and got along well, and I suggested going for a drink sometime. We ran into each other again recently, and he suggested having lunch together on Friday. 

The fact that he accepted my proposal to meet one-on-one makes me think he might also be interested. But at the same time, the idea of lunch seems more like a friendly get-together than my initial proposal to go for a drink. 

Should I see this as a subtle way for him to let me know that it's purely a friendly meeting? Not enough context to really tell, but it depends on if he goes for it or not when you do meet him. You never mentioned if you are interested in him or not [Commentator's opinion]"
"Hello! I'm a younger guy thats wondering about good places to meet someone? I've never liked the idea of dating apps and I'm not a big fan of social media, but that just seems to be the way everyone meets now. I've also never been big on partying or the bar scene. I come from a small town and I'm very active within my community, but most of the people I meet through community service projects are much older than myself. I also have a couple of hobbies but I rarely meet girls through them, and it seems like the ones I do meet are in a relationship. I've been single for a little while now and I'm ready to meet someone, but  I just don't really know where to go. In my previous relationships I've always met girls through friends or family, and those situations always just happened naturally, but now I rarely meet anyone new like that. So if you guys could recommend some places to check out I would greatly appreciate it! Go to the supermarket bar with a wingman/woman, or just alone. You don’t have to “drink drink”. Try improv class or some other community activity that draws younger people in. Your post super resonates and I’m not much of a bar/club person either but my friends and I are planning a club night just to see. Take dancing classes, or go to dance events on meetup. How far are you from a city? Can you just venture out a little bit? [Practical Advice]"
"I was married for 7 years from 2012-2019. I was treated poorly in every aspect. Verbally abused pretty bad and controlled in alot of ways. But I was used to it and it was my normal and I thought it was normal.  After my divorce I  met some men casually. But it’s been two years since I’ve tried to get out there.

I finally got back out there and wow. I didn’t know this was the correct way to treat someone. He cares about things, my wants and dislike and genuinely takes me into consideration. He doesn’t yell or get mad or negate the way I feel. The way I cook, the way I do things he likes it and does not downgrade me. It seems like he actually really loves me.

Even sexually. He is always kissing me, holding my hand, touching my butt when he can when no one is near, kissing my neck, touching my leg when he’s driving, kissing everywhere and not trying to have sex every time. He just wants to be close to me and feel me. Not looking to have sex every single time and it feels good for him to want to want to just kiss me all around and enjoy it. He’s an amazing kisser and we just enjoy it together and touching each other.  I’ve had this too. She was both anxious attachment & touch oriented person as am I and when you find each other it’s incredibly enveloping and special. Like a constant literal warm hug. Congrats and enjoy 😊 [Emotional Support]"
"I 36/F have been dating 35/M for the last month but we have years knowing each other prior. Dates have been great, chemistry has been great. We have similar looks on life and for the future. 

However, he is not able to finish with me. Today I asked if he’s been able to finish with other women, that he may have been seeing the last month and he’s been able to. He feels like we may not be sexually compatible, but we get horny for each other every single time. He just doesn’t finish with me. 

This is the first time I’ve gone through this, most of my relationships in the past have been sexual leading. The main part of them is the sex. So I at least had that, but now it’s the first time someone can’t with me. He expresses he has feelings for me and we can spend a lot of time together but he just can’t cum with me. He’s not sure if he can get there with me but has these strong feelings for me too. 

I just feel very confused. My ego is a little hurt too. My self esteem feels off. 
 This happens to me sometimes. It's just nerves. I rarely watch porn and use a very loose grip solo - so none of the usual culprits. [Commentator's opinion]"
"
There’s always so much talk and support about being cheated on and infidelity from the viewpoint of the partner being cheated on. I never see much about the devastation of finding out you’re the other woman (or man) 
Being misled from the beginning, forming a bond that you now have to accept as fake. 
I, 34/F was dating “Nate” 32/M for about 1yr. 
I am now finding out that Nate was in a 4-year  relationship the whole time and his partner 33/F was even pregnant while we were intimate. 
I don’t know how to feel. I know I shouldn’t miss something that was never real or genuine, and I shouldn’t want someone like that. 
Still, the thought of them together, working it out, and him discarding me like nothing still hurts. I guess it’s natural when you thought you had something special with someone. And I truly loved him. Part of me wishes she’d leave because he doesn’t deserve to be in a relationship after doing that to me, but it’s not my call what another woman chooses to put up with. This was no casual fling or one night stand. I hate feeling like nothing, like they still have each other, their own family and I’m left with all the pain while he gets off unscathed. We have not spoken since I revealed that I know the truth and exposed him. I’m not surprised, that was just for context. It’s just an unfair situation that I don’t see talked about much. 
I just want to reiterate that I had no idea, and this is all coming out over a year later. I’d never willingly be the other woman and then cry about it. I didn’t know. He lied to you so many times over - you are a victim in his messed up game just like his partner. I’m sorry it happened to you and that you’re grieving the potential of a relationship that was built on lies and are left picking up the pieces. 

Did you tell his partner?? She’s also building a life outta lies. [Emotional Support]"
"I recently graduated college. During college, I dated someone for about a year. We broke up 10 months ago, and ever since then I have thought of her very often. I think about her in passing at least once a day. We had some issues in our relationship, but I broke up with her over a specific situation.

A few months ago I met someone new (Let's call her Sue) and we began seeing each other, but have not labelled the relationship. She is everything I could want in a partner.

A few weeks ago, I received information about the situation my ex and I broke up over that made me realize that I was completely in the wrong. I had always felt regretful about ending the relationship, but that made it 10x worse. I reached out to her after a long period of no contact. She gave me some closure but was absolutely not interested in getting back together.

I was absolutely crushed. But things have been getting better, even if I still think about my ex a lot. Meanwhile, things have been getting more serious with Sue and she has been hinting she wants our relationship to be official soon.

I have feelings for Sue, but I also have a lot of regret for ending my relationship with my ex. I know the right thing to do is to break things off, but it feels dumb to do so when Sue has treated me super well and is someone that I would want to date. Look at your last relationship as a learning experience. Maybe it’s taking you longer to get over it because you held on to the idea of getting back together. As time goes on, you will get over it.

"I’ve 35M been seeing this woman 50F for almost 2 years. It’s been great so far, she takes very good care of me, our place we live in together and cooks for us almost every night. I also cook for myself a lot too as I eat a lot. She does most of the housework and I will admit I should be putting in more effort towards these chores. About a month ago she started giving me the silent treatment after an argument, in the argument I ended up getting a bit stern and told her it’s very rude to ignore someone in the middle of conversation thus the silient treatment starting. 

She went to work the next day and wouldn’t allow me to pick her up, I believe she skipped work and went and gambled her money away somewhere as I could hear wind in the phone like she was waiting outside for the bus somewhere. We had a long phone call where she said basically nothing as I repeatedly asked where she was and if she was coming home(4pm)  I ended up staying up till midnight that night waiting for her and when I finally gave up and went to bed she was there sleeping already. I didn’t get home until about 8pm that night so there is a chance she was there the whole time or she snuck in while I was cooking. This was a few months ago. The next day she was fine and over it as was i. 

Two days ago she admitted to recently  gambling all of her money away and wouldn’t tell me how much, I’m guessing 3-6k. She stated she wouldn’t have her share of rent money (800) and needed to borrow 900 to send home to her family. I told her if we went and signed out of the casinos for two years together I would do it. Then yesterday she did the same thing as last time, wouldn’t let me pick her up and on the phone I could hear wind. Saying she would stay at work and work the next day, which is usually her day off. I asked her if she’s staying there forever and she said maybe. She wouldn’t tell me anything. I asked what I did to deserve this and she went silent. This morning she texts me good morning as if nothing is wrong to which I replied with ( …… ) 

How do I navigate my partners addiction, im not going to break up with her in her critical condition right now but how much can a guy take ? I know people need their personal time but can’t I be given some sort of explanation ? How many red flags do you guys see here, maybe it’s time I find someone my own age, I have no one to talk to about this, looking for honest opinions as I’m wracking my brain trying to figure this out. Thanks in advance.  So many red flags.

I seriously hope your finances are fully separate - no joint accounts, no authorized user on your cards, etc - because she will burn through everything you have.

She sounds mentally unwell. To be 50 and running away and giving the silent treatment? To gamble away 3-6k so quickly? Needing to borrow from her bf to pay rent? 

If you were married that would be considered financial infidelity. 

I’m going to be honest… I don’t think I could stay with a boyfriend who acted like that. I don’t think I could sit by and watch a boyfriend blow up their life through a gambling addiction. I’d probably make him an ex-boyfriend unless he put himself into addiction treatment and showed me through his actions that he was trying with his whole heart to heal/deal with the addiction and change the way he treated me.

"My aunt reached out to me and my sister the other day, and asked us if we were free to hang out with her and some of our cousins. We said yes. These plans came up while talking to my mom, who got upset and said that my sister and I were not allowed to go (she said things like, “if you don’t go you don’t love or respect me”) and actually forbade us from going. 

Back story: apparently on the last trip my parents took a few months ago, my aunt made plans with my other aunts (her siblings) and did not invite my parents. I believe my aunt told my other aunts to not mention it to my parents. My mom was hurt and to my understanding is in an unspoken fight with my aunt.

My mom also said that my aunt was not invited to MY wedding next year, and that if my aunt attends she will not go to my wedding. My mom pulled a similar stunt at my sibling’s wedding years ago, and threatened to not attend that wedding the night before.

I’m writing this because I don’t know what to do and I’m really starting to get annoyed with getting caught in the middle of family drama. It’s isolating and in my opinion life is too short to latch onto negativity. I feel like if I don’t put my foot down now, it’s going to enable this authoritarian type relationship. If I do put my foot down, I risk shattering my relationship with my mom.

I’m an adult, I don’t live in her house, I have a full time job. I have mostly always listened to my mom for small things to keep the peace because I do feel she feels the need to be in control and in charge, but as I’m getting older her attempts to control me and my decisions are annoying, immature, and tiring. I do feel like she treats me and my siblings as pawns and as an extension of herself rather than our individual selves sometimes; I know she loves and cares about us but she pulls these stunts sometimes and it is emotionally and mentally tiring. I do love her and care about her, but I know her personality and our relationship is complex.

Should I give in and listen to her or put my foot down? Go and see your aunt. You’re an adult. It’s time for mom to start acting like one as well.  [Practical Advice]"

"I’m a 33F Asian ‘happily’ married to a 33M Asian. We have been dating for about 7 years prior to marriage.

My husband has been really amazing. He really loves me (kisses me, hugs me, tells me he loves me very frequently, irons my clothes, does laundry, cleans the house). He is also good looking. I mean he is literally everything you can ask for in a man except for when it comes to sex! 

I am a very open minded person, I assumed we never had sex before marriage as he respected our culture. Unfortunately it has been a sexless marriage for the past 5 years. 

Initially I’ve been extremely frustrated but shy to bring this issue up. The one time I confronted him, it became an argument and quickly made me feel like I’m not cultured enough for bringing this topic up. He even said at multiple occasions that marriage is not about sex. He gave multiple reasons for refusal- claiming he feels extremely ticklish & he does not know what to do (PS he works under healthcare). The most we have done is kiss. Whenever I touch him further he pushes me away saying he is ticklish. And if I go further he says I’m purposely doing it knowing that he can’t take it. We have never even seen each other naked. And honestly whatever love that I had for him has been wearing off. I can’t even recall when I last initiated kissing him because I know that it’s not going to become anything more intimate. 

Most of the time I’m just wondering if he is gay. I’ve confronted him once about it and it pissed him off. And there was once he said it’s because we are not ready to have kids. I mean how dumb can a person be to know that having sex is not equal to wanting to have kids now. Also being an Asian, his mother has been bugging me on when I’m going to give her grandkids. 

I’ve been focusing on my career and let this past trying to not let it haunt me. However it is getting more and more frustrating as I am a very sensual person. I do not know how to bring it up anymore as everytime I talk about it, the isn’t any conclusion. I mean it’s been so many years, anyone else would have left the relationship. I don’t even know why I’m staying- like I said except for absence of sex; he is really a gem. 

What should I do? I pretty much know communication is the key solution; but it is so hard to communicate about this.  Tell him if things don't change, you gotta go. You can either choose to continue to be shy about this (which is not working), or start having the hard conversation. [Practical Advice]"
"Hey everyone, Well this is my first time posting on Reddit.

Well I(21F) met this guy(21M) through a mutual friend, and it's been only three days since we started talking to each other and we haven't met in real life yet. On the first day of texting, he kinda seemed nice and sweet, but out of nowhere he asked me if I could be his forever and if we could make this journey together to which I told him that we should slow down as I didn't want to rush things up.

And after just two days, he texted me that he loves me a lot, misses me, and wants me so badly which made me feel a bit uncomfortable. We are not even officially dating yet, and he's already asking if I would leave him by any chance. 

This really made me feel a bit uncomfortable. Is this normal, or am I right to feel uneasy about this situation? Is it a red flag?

"My boyfriend is currently on a family vacation to a place I’ve longed to visit for years. We’ve been together for nearly a year now, and he’s told me serval times how much he doesn’t enjoy going on family vacations and in fact, hardly ever does. This time around I was told he’s being forced to go as his mom booked his flight for him, and like idk. That genuinely pissed me off. I guess I’m jealous? His family is very close knit and come from a well off place, whereas I’ve got no siblings, don’t speak to my aunts or uncles and cousins, absent father, etc. and have always been very lower class. I’ve been busting my ass for years to get to where I can take vacations out of the country for myself, but with inflation and everything going on now it’s very hard. 

Anyway, I just I don’t know how to feel. The family always invites his sibling’s partner and they go on family vacations, but I didn’t get so little as an invite which has me wondering if I’m even liked by the family, or they just know I can’t afford it. (Idk which hurts most lol) and then I guess I’m just fucking jealous. My boyfriend wasn’t happy to go which made me more angry cause he sounded so fucking entitled. God forbid he has to go on an all paid vacation with a loving family to a GORGEOUS place on this planet, you know? 

I’m trying to be my normal loving self to him and talk to him like normal. He says he misses me while he’s out there and is telling me that he will do his best to send me pictures and stuff to make me feel like I’m there with him, and while it’s sweet and so considerate of him it makes me more angry. 

What should I do? How can I be pretend to be fine and message him like normal when deep down I’m VERY unhappy? I love this man with my whole entire heart, and wish him the best. I genuinely want him to have fun and enjoy his time out there, he deserves it. What can I say or do to not ruin his trip? I don’t want to show him how I’m feeling cause it’s not fair to him. 

(For the record, yes I spoke to him about this months ago when it got planned. I told him I was jealous and angry and apologized to him for feeling that way. He was super understanding and got my point of view and I thought that was that. But now that it’s here, now that it’s actually happening and he’s there, everything flooded back.) TIA You just have to get over it. It’s literally a you problem because no one has done anything wrong and there’s no “solution” here. You need to deal with your own jealousy and stop projecting it onto other people [Hurtful]"
"So, I’ve(M18) recently come to terms with the fact that despite my best attempts, i’m definitely a nerd, and i enjoy being a nerd. 

With that realization has come the epiphany that i really like nerdy girls, too. My question is this: Where do I find nerdy girls?? There’s no dating app (no stealing my idea 😡), and the only place that we nerds gather is in virtual spaces (most of the time, anyways). 

If nobody else has any ideas, I’m just going to start wearing a Gojo costume into anime conventions (i’ve never watched jjk). Nerdy girls are easy to find actually, the problem is having them like you [Commentator's opinion]"
"Hi! :) 
I’m 25 F, and I have had the worst luck trying to find a partner. I have had one serious relationship (3 1/2 years) which ended a year ago. I really only use dating apps (Tinder, Hinge, Bumble) because going out is hard for me since I have bad anxiety and not many friends. The last three or four guys I’ve talked to have ghosted me or had started texting less and less until it was nothing. I don’t think I’m too bad looking, I have a stable job, my own place, I think I have a good personality, kind of funny, and I’m very independent. I just don’t understand what I’m doing wrong or how I can fix it. I’m getting super discouraged and would like any advice anyone can give! I’m not desperate, but I really just want someone to start settling down with and give love to (which might sound weird or stupid lol). Again, any advice would be appreciated! Thanks for reading :)  Without seeing how the texting went, really hard to pinpoint to an issue. AS a male, this has happened multiple times---started texting with someone, it was going well, and suddenly, gone. Never knew what really happened. I even showed my texting to my female friends and they were also baffled as to why the other person stopped texting, other than, she found somebody else.  On my last venture on dating apps, took me about 1.5 years to find my current gf. There were some discouraging times, but kept on trucking as they say.  Maybe as the cliché says, gotta keep on trying, being patient and soon, you'll have somebody. In fact, the woman I'm seeing now...of all the dates I had, it was the least likely I thought to have actually developed into something. First date went meh, and we jus kept in touch to make fun of online dating, but kept on doing some activities together until i guess we realized, this is not too bad...let's date again....😀 [Emotional Support]"
"I live in an apartment building, where lots of people get along and approaching neighbours isn't unusual. Some people go for a smoke together etc. I have had few chats with like, 3 people I think. One of them has knocked on my door asking for a matches, for example.

So few days ago in the evening there is a knock and I assume it's someone asking for a salt or something like that. Opened the door and there is a guy I have talked to briefly twice I think. Absolutely nothing flirty or sexual, not even close.

Without any intro, he asked if I want to have sex. I am very reserved and introverted and tend to get into freeze mode when I'm shocked. So I just stared and he kept saying something. Finally I managed to say that I don't do that, I don't sleep with strangers. I mean, yes, I could have said no and slammed the door shut, but that is what my brain thought is appropriate to say. He sayd something else and I think he said he would go for a wash and come back later. Again, I just stood there, trying to understand what the heck is going on. He left and I closed my door. Tbh, I was quite shocked. 

He actually came back, several times to knock. I said nothing, just hoped he would leave. 

I will see him again, he lives here too. What can I say the next time I see him? I find it very difficult to talk to people and only do it if someone approaches me in a friendly and safe manner. 

I want to make sure he gets the message that this question was extremely inappropriate, harassing and I am not interested. 

Tldr. Neighbour I don't know very well knocked on my door and asked if I want have sex. I panicked, he left. What to say hi when I see him next time, so he would understand this is unwanted.  If its (understandly) uncomfortable and difficult for you to talk to him about it in person, then maybe put a note through his letterbox. [Practical Advice]"

"Okay, so my boyfriend and I come from really different backgrounds. I’m a European Muslim ‘23F’ he’s a Caribbean Catholic ‘23M’. We’re both from New York City. We have been together for 3 years. 

The women he’s dated before me have all been petite, Hispanic women with tattoos and long black hair. 

I ‘23F’ am a tall, pale white woman with short brown hair. 

His instagram following has always been women that are “his type” even though he’s always denied having a type. 

One time I asked him what made his ex girlfriend more attractive than me and he said “I mean you’re both pretty but she’s short and Colombian” and that made me feel really insecure. He has also said similar things to this in the past. For example: he once said he watches mainly Latina porn (then took it back and said he was just joking) 

It was months ago and it makes me wanna cry every time I think about it. I can’t mention it to him anymore because I’ve already brought it up so many times and he always says “I didn’t mean it like that” 

I do know he loves me but I think he fell in love with my personality. I don’t think I’m his “dream girl” if that makes sense. It kinda makes me hate everything about myself. I’ve started growing out my hair to be long, dying it jet black, got lip fillers, started going to the gym more, dress different than I normally do, got small tattoos and piercings. He does try to reassure me that he loves me for who I am. But it just doesn’t feel that way. 

If I walked into a room with all his former girlfriends, I know he wouldn’t pick me. 

He 23M keeps denying having a type but it drives me crazy because I know he does and I know I am not his type. I feel more insecure than ever. I’ve even started changing my appearance.  How to resolve this ?  He does like you. He's attracted to you. He chooses you. The problem here is you, and it's not your looks. You resolve it by working on loving yourself and seeing yourselves as a unique individual who is worthy of love. Thinking about people as types is lazy, shallow bullshit. We might have traits we are attracted to - but you fall in love with a whole person. [Emotional Support]"
"Just so we are clear it's not her V that smells bad. It's a actually odorless and I love to go down.


But for some reason while we are having sex her bedsheet smell kind of like my armpit after a long day. I have also noticed her clothes smell like this as well. She is from a third world country so I'm not sure if maybe it's what they use to wash their clothes, or maybe it's all the Nair she applies to her whole body... which I know for a fact can make sweat smell like sulfur.

Is there a polite way of pointing this out because I think she is unaware.

I really do love her though. 

And just for context I'm from a third world as well. It's just that she is fresh off the boat if you know what I mean. Any chance it's a musty smell like the sheets were left in the washer too long?  [Commentator's opinion]"
"so I met this girl at a convenient store, we kinda liked each other first glance and I decided to give it a shot and it worked, we texted a lot but due to my social awkward, I rarely spoke XD, we meetup at cafe net but I rarely talk, so I man up and ask her like if she would like to grab some snack outside but she said no, I shocked for a bit and decide to go out and eat sth myself cuz shit was so awkward if some1 doesn't talk, the moment I return she was already gone XDDD, should I ask her to go to the movie next time She said no, leave her alone and move on to someone else. You don’t know her situation and why she said but ultimately shes not interested in you and thats ok. Find a woman that is interested in you, don’t double back after you were already rejected.

"Hi, me 23F have been dating my bf 23M for 5 years now. Recently, everything has been great and I was prepared to move in together until I finally learned the truth. At the beginning of our relationship, he cheated on me with his ex who at the time was 23F and he was 18M. For years, I alway had my doubts but he made me believe nothing happened between them. He was still in love with his ex and talking to her almost daily the first two years of our relationship Whenever I asked if he ever cheated the answer was always ""why don't you trust me? Why would I ever cheat on you?"" We've been through so much together and I wholeheartedly love him but I'm stuck. Do i break up with the man who has lied and manipulated me these past 5 years? Or should I stick around hoping he'll change and we can move last this?  This was probably the third biggest lie I have encountered in the relationship but I'm holding onto hope and the love I have for him. I don't have anyone in my personal life to talk to about this so any advance is helpful. Thank you

"I´m very confused right now. I hooked up with a guy for several years. Weeks ago I asked him if it could lead to more than this and I told him that I wanted more than this and explained that I have feelings for him. He was very vague when it came to an answer, but our contact was dead after that. We didn´t text anymore, nothing.

I was okay with it and started dating again. I found a serious guy and things are going well, we went on  a few dates and he is looking for a long term relationship. My ex fwb must have heard about him, idk. But he texted me tonight..asking if we can talk. He regrets the things he said and is open to more.

What do I need to do now? This can't be true. Is it normal to change your mind when you find out she is dating someone else???

The new guy is serious and safe (but I was more into my ex fwb). With my ex fwb I'm feeling like, what can I expect now again (while tbh I'm head over heels about him). I would like to explore things more serious with my fwb.

Advice about this please. Has anyone ever been in such a situation? Or has anyone ever been like my ex fwb? Please dont go back! Alot of times guys do this because they don’t want anyone else to have you! He’ll probably say anything and do everything to get you back but please stick with this serious guy! [Practical Advice]"
"If I was the partner, I would want to know. I have a friend who cheated on their partner and I am still friends with them and did not tell their partner at the time. I carry this secret with them. 

I wonder how people would have handled the situation differently has it been their friend.  This is too open a question to have a one size fits all answer. How close am I to this friend? How close am I to their partner? How long have they been together? Are they just dating or are they married? Do they have kids? Was this a one off mistake or a pattern of cheating? Did my friend tell me this in confidence because they felt guilty about what they did? Or were they bragging cause they got away with it? Have I wanted my friend to break up with a toxic partner for a while? Or is their partner someone I have a lot of value and respect for?

Ultimately I'd rather not know then be put in a situation where I have to live with the knowledge that my friend cheated. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I hope this doesn't come off as shallow. I've been married to my wife for over 20 years. We have one kid that's in college. When we were first married my wife and I enjoyed working out together, we hiked and biked and were very active. When my son was born, we continued to be active and still exercised together.

About 5 years ago she stopped exercising and doing anything active. Since then, she has gained over 45 lbs. and has really let herself go. She doesn't wear any makeup anymore and even her hair is always a mess. She even refuses to shower, when it's obvious that she should.

I thought at first it was depression, and we went to a couple doctors, and she insists it isn't depression and the doctors agreed with her. She insists she just doesn't care about her appearance anymore. She doesn't ever wear anything attractive, even if we go out for dinner or on a date. 

The problem is I do care about appearance. I take care of myself physically and dress appropriately. I feel nothing for her physically and we never have sex, because I was always the initiator. 

I've tried to get her to exercise, and she doesn't want to. We tried hiking and because she is so out of shape she turned around after 15 minutes. I don't know what to do. I'm too young to live in a marriage where my partner doesn't care about appearance or sex.  Have you had a very frank discussion with her, and while a couple of doctors say she is okay, maybe you have not gone to good ones, or ones that are appropriate for this diagnosis.  She needs to see a mental health professional, and a good and qualified one.  Failing to perform basic hygiene practices is NOT normal.  

Acts of intimacy are normal and healthy in marriage.  Your wife needs to be made aware that you love her, but have needs that are not being met, and you are not happy right now, and want to know why she does not want to be intimate with you.  This may help her recognize that she has lost confidence in herself due to her appearance, or that something is not right with her mental health and she needs help. [Practical Advice]"
"So for some background about me, I’ve only had two relationships previously, both long term that lasted 4+ years. 
The first one was typical school dating, holding hands and first kisses. 
The second one was much more serious, we were each others first everything. It was a really deep relationship that sort of abruptly ended about 8 months ago. 

My current boyfriend and I have been dating for nearly 2 months. He’s the sweetest, most understanding, loyal, loving and selfless person I’ve ever met. We just clicked out of nowhere and have been attached since, despite still working through our own issues. 

I never thought I was the insecure type until I started dating him however, he’s told me all about his past relationships and can go on and on about crazy sex stories or drug stories. 

Honestly, it makes me feel a little insecure that he’s had so many more partners than me, and so much more life experience. Like, i don’t judge him..and he doesn’t compare me to any of his ex’s, or even talk about them unless brought up. 

But a part of me feels like I’m in a competition. I feel embarrassed that he’s a lot of my firsts and I’m none of his. I’m just looking for advice on how to get over this weird feeling. 

TDRL: bf has way more life experience and I feel embarrassed that I don’t and can’t give him the same feelings he gives me Trust your intuition and all the signs. [Practical Advice]"
"I’m 26 (M), the girl I’m dating is 23 (F). I’ve been talking to this girl for about six months told me that she deleted her Instagram and deactivated it. I ended up finding out that she still has her Instagram and I just assumed that she probably just deleted the app and doesn’t use it anymore. Then I see that later on she still has one and is active on it because she recently followed somebody around two hours after she told me that she doesn’t have one. I honestly don’t know why she would lie to me. I have never once said anything about her having one or not and it obviously would not be an issue for me if she did. So I asked her again the next day if she really doesn’t have one just to be sure. She again told me she deactivated it. She blatantly lied to my face. I haven’t confronted her on it but I really don’t know what to do in this situation. What would be the reasons she would lie about this? And what would be the best way to go about this situation? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.  You gotta talk to her about this, my dude. We have no clue why she's saying this.

"I’ve been seeing a girl for nearly 3 months now. We see eachother a lot, maybe abit to much but all in all it’s going well enough. But i’m not starting to wonder if i want anything to do with her anymore. I feel recently she has done a few things to set of my red flag alarms, little things like taking her phone to very short bathroom trips, being quite cheeky and combative humor wise, she told me the other day at my house she was going home to get a shower and grab her work uniform for the next day, she returned over an hour later with no uniform, didn’t smell like she had a shower and my gut just screamed she’s lying, another one if quickly pocketing her phone when she saw me appear one day, then shortly after when she went to use it again she got up and stood facing me which again sent major flags off. I’ve been cheated on before and i feel she had a lot of cheating vibes about her. She tells me she loves me & wants to hook a holiday together for september, but im seriously suspicious she’s seeing someone else. I got with her just as she got out of a relationship, but she said she had mentally checked out off it long before she emded it. I just feel like im being cheated on, seeing signs of it anyway. abit paranoid. on top of all this she always seems very distant, not very talkative sometimes, and just the lights are on but nobody is home type of vibe. I don’t know what to do but i feel very uncomfortable  You're thinking about breaking up and asking strangers instead of asking her? You two seem to hit it off well. [Sarcasm]"
"I have a history with disordered eating. My husband recently has become very healthy in terms of food choices. He started only eating one meal a day about a year ago. He now wants to give up refined sugar completely (no dessert, no fruit, no bread, no pasta) and only eat whole grains, protein, and vegetables. He wants us to optimize our health and set similar rules for our young children.

I thought I had finally reached a point where I am comfortable with my own food choices and enjoying things in moderation. While I do sometimes overindulge with dessert, I no longer binge or hide food or other bad habits. The recent conversations around food have been extremely triggering. We are constantly talking about food and I am constantly feeling guilty about my choices and what I am doing to our children. I feel like a failure that I am not able to give up sugar, or more accurately that I do not want to give up sugar. I am extremely angry with my husband and resentful that he is harping on this topic every time we have a second to talk.

While I agree somewhat with him about reducing our sugar intake, I feel he is too extreme. I am super depressed that we have so little in common around food. One of my hobbies is baking and the fact that I can no longer do that for my family to enjoy is also super depressing and another source of resentment. My husband insists I need to just stop eating emotionally and we will be in alignment.

If it was just the two of us, I would be able to do my own thing but we are struggling to be consistent with our children. How do we move forward? I don't think there's anything wrong with HIM sticking to whole grains, protein, and vegetables, but he is bonkers crazy for trying to impose that on you and WORSE, your children. That is so incredibly unhealthy for him to even consider doing that. 

DO NOT allow him to do this to your children. They will be binging junk food out of the house and grow up with an incredibly dangerous relationship with food. PLEASE don't let him hurt your children like this. PLEASE keep baking so that your children can enjoy food. [Practical Advice]"
"My fiancée (28F) is a first generation French immigrant who moved to the US for college 10 years ago and became a US citizen 4 years ago. 

Her parents and grandparents all still live in France and she visits them a few times a year. I went with her on a trip to France after we got engaged and had been together for a yea  to see and be introduced to her family. The entire time it was tense and hostile.

I guess my Fiancée didn’t tell her family that I was black because I could just tell by their face that they weren’t expecting it when they first saw me. She didn't send them pictures or anything of me. Her grandparents especially (who are in their 80’s and 90’s) kept making comments in French that I couldn’t understand but I knew were bad since my fiancée would respond in an aggressive/defensive way in French whenever they would make them.

Once we got back we had a discussion about the whole thing and she told me that her family is very proud of their country and its culture/history. They apparently have a bad impression of black Americans as lazy criminals or something (she didn’t say that directly but kinda referenced it) and apparently my girlfriend got an angry email from her father about a week after we got back that she “might as well sterilize herself” because she’s ending her bloodline. I even put it in google translate to make sure that’s what it said.

I kinda understand now why she didn’t tell them about me or send them pictures, but I don’t know how this will work in the future if we actually get married. How did I go about this?

 Her family is crappy, but to spring that situation on you with no warning was really bad judgement. Like really bad judgement. 

If that doesn’t give you second thoughts, I think maybe some counseling or a neutral third party (cause counseling is expensive in US) is in order to go over the implications of how this will impact the future. If you have kids, you wouldn’t want them subjected to hate like that. Which means NC for your & your children with her family. Is she prepared for that? Is she prepared to be cut off by her family or be forced (by their behavior) to go NC or LC? [Commentator's opinion]"
"My boyfriend and I have been together for about 2 years now and I've noticed that he never really seems interested in me sending him nudes. For example, I sent him a couple of pics yesterday after I showered and he just sent a heart emoji and thats it. He didn't screenshot or anything like that either.

I know its not an issue of him not being attracted to me because when we're together he's all over me but it just doesn't make me feel so great when I know most other guys his age would probably show more interest in them.

He's also not uncomfortable with receiving them or anything like that. Just wondering why he might be reacting like that or why he doesn't seem to like them?  I actually do not want nudes of anyone I'm dating. Some guys are just not into it. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I’ve been seeing someone for a few months, and things have been great so far! 

Over the past few days, something about our text conversations just seems..off? 

I’m not sure if I’m getting too in my head; or if there are subtle signs that this person may be giving via text that he’s no longer interested. 

From a male perspective - what are some things you do to subtly let a girl know that you’ve lost interest, or that your feelings have shifted to more platonic rather than romantic?  it wouldnt be so much in what i would say, but more so in what i'd do in my actions.

the conversation would become more friendly, i'd stop using words like ""babe"", i'd probably msg less often n even avoiding, i would cancel plans more often n say im busy.

i guess to summarize everything in two words: friendly and avoidant.

on the flip side, we'll just come right out n say what the deal is n tell u to move on romantically. [Commentator's opinion]"

"Let’s set the scene. It’s May and I’m talking to this girl, let’s call her Ashley, and she eventually confessed that she likes me. While I would call this a W for me, I’m concerned on if I’m breaking bro code. One of my bros, call him Joey, and her were in a talking stage for a little bit way back in September, but it only lasted a couple weeks after my bro decided to shut it down. She eventually met me and my roommate when we were sitting next to Joey’s friend, she decided to come sit with us along with one of her friends. After a while (I’d say two to three months after this) we started going on walks together, usually with my roommate or her friend accompanying us, but it eventually became us two alone and we started to talk to each other and have deep convos. It wasn’t long after that she confessed and I’ve been stumped. She’s a great woman and I can definitely see myself dating her. However, I can’t shake this one thing. I talked about it with my roommate and he says he sees no foul and I’m gonna bring it up to Joey at some point, but I wanna get the public opinion. Is this a violation of bro code? I spoke to the other Bros, and after further review the ruling on the field is confirmed.  No violation is detected, proceed with your courtship. [Sarcasm]"
"needing advice: I (M21) have had a thing with one of my friends (F21) in the area nothing serious just some flirting and playing about. id been working up the balls to ask her out officially but before i could she told me she was moving away for UNI and that she had found a Boyfriend to move in with. because of this we never really talked and we kinda grew apart.

recently she told me that she\`d broken up with the BF and had moved back because she was finished with UNI. we had got back in touch and the flirting has escalated into almost phone sex levels. however again before i could progress our relationship she went quite. now she was always slow to reply but now i\`m being left on read and it seems like she wants nothing to do with me.

i cant stop thinking about her to the point i\`m not interested in other woman but she doesn't seem to feel the same. i cant even talk to her because shes ignoring me.

 You are plan B. Hell, maybe C or D. Block her. It may sound overkill but you will never be able to have a platonic relationship with her, she will always try to drag you into the ""almost boyfriend zone"" be cause that's her power move. Block, forget, move on. You're only 21 dude. Trust me, interest in other women will be back in no time. [Practical Advice]"

"my ex broke up with me 7 months ago saying she wasn't feeling the spark anymore (she didn't cheat). As we were friends from the childhood (not homie type, just good friends), after breakup she tried to stay in contact as friends. i ignored her most of the time because i needed recovery.

She contacted me after 2 days of the breakup asking how i was doing, i just replied good and ignored her. She tried to initiate conversations many times like she went on a movie,what were my plans on a festive day,she had exams that she was worried about etc.I ignore all of those. I have muted her from all of my socials but she always reacts to my posts and stories to this date.

I can say that i have moved on.But the thing is that she was really a good girl. Now i am having this feeling that maybe i should talk to her if she wants to get back with me again. Until now i was mad at the fact that she was the one who showed interest in me 1st, so I don't care about the current so called friendship that only she wants to keep,it is gone anyway.

I have been saving up for years and making sure my credit is impeccable ever since I was 18. I’ve had a very hard life, and I have finally been able to say I am able to reach my goal of owning a home. My boyfriend is also in on this, and with both of our incomes we can definitely afford a decent home in the current market. 

With this being said, he has no savings and is absolutely terrible with money. He also has no credit history, and relied on me adding him to my accounts in order for us to get approved for a loan. Essentially, this will be my hard work. 

My boyfriend and I are into cars and that’s how we met. He, on a whim, purchased an older sports car for $1,500 about a year ago. I wasn’t totally against it, but I raised a huge concern because of him only able to afford this car because he happened to have made a significantly larger pay check the week before. 

I was excited d about the car because it is fun, and for $1,500 it didn’t ruin us or cause any tension money wise. But when I asked to drive the car, he fully declined and said it was his car and he “worked hard to be able to afford it”. 

Fast forward to last week, after being approved with an amazing interest rate in todays market, I stated how this house is fully mine, and how betrayed I feel that I can sacrifice years of my wants to be able to do this for us. He still has yet to budge and refuses to let me drive the car. 

Would this be a dealbreaker for anyone else?  When I was a teenager I owned 2 60's hot rods. I was dating 2 girls and totally honest to both and had only had 2 both long term girlfriends at that point. Then I met this girl, while cruising in one of my hot rods and we hit it off. I  imedidatly warned her I already had 2 girlfriends and wouldn't have much time for a third,  then when she asked about the next day and I told her I was putting a new engine in one of my hot rods she asked if she could help. She showed up the next morning and helped lower the engine lift and with other things. She not only ended up driving both (preferring them to her brand new car (graduation present) and ended up marrying her. Divorced now but still good friends. [Not Relevant]"
"I (20F) like this guy (20M) but I am several inches taller. I’m 178cm (5’10)  and I would estimate he is 165 cm (5’5). The height difference does not bother me at all but I am worried he might not like it. I do not know how to make it known I like him and the height difference is not a big deal. 

I have talked to guys shorter than me before and it was always a hurdle to get them to understand their height is not an issue. 
 Talk to him the way you would anyone else you wanted to date. Don't mention height unless he asks. [Practical Advice]"
"I am 37F, he is 48M. We have been dating for a year and he proposed. I said yes because he is a responsible, kind, tolerant and family oriented men. 

About a month before his proposal, I found a letter that he wrote to his EX-EX girlfriend (31F) saying how sorry he was, he misses her EVERYDAY and the biggest mistake he made was not realising how happy they were. Long story short, he was seeking ways to get back together. I confronted him, he said he wrote it at the start of our relationship and he forgot about it. It looks like drunk writing. 

He has over 3000 pictures on his phone and they pops up very often, I don’t even have to look for them, they are just around. That’s why he misses her everyday.  I’m not strong enough to ask him to delete all the pictures because I know I have no right to do it since I already ask him to unfollow her on Instagram (don’t want to be reminded all the time big data pushes her to me). This little chapter happened and has become an underlying issue in my head that she is his true love. if the girl sees a chance to be with him again in the future, what decision is he gonna make?  He is with me just because I’m here and I seemed like a right choice for wife? 

If I’m 10 years younger, I would just walk away, easy. What should I do, it’s a life decision to make. 
  Walk away now! It will be much harder in 5 years when he will be treating you like shit because you are not his ex. You can't possibly be and whatever you will do - it won't be good enough.

Very unfortunately men like to marry good women to make them jump through the hoops to cater to their needs. Just so you know, the second his ex will move a finger, he wilk be there at the speed of light.

Leave now and find someone who is head over heels for you. [Practical Advice]"
"My girlfriend quit vaping two months ago. Since then, I've frequently reminded her of how proud I am of her and I assure her I am here to support her in any way. Recently, she has been undergoing a lot of stress from a summer job leading to burnout. Today, she has been expressing to me how much she wants to buy a new vape, but she doesn't want for me to be disappointed. My disappointment is the only thing holding her back. I have always told her that I would be honest and that I would be disappointed. I reassure her that I am not telling her she cannot vape and that it is ultimately her decision to make. I remind her that I will support her and love her regardless. How am I supposed to navigate this? 

I don't know what to say because the conversation always returns to her saying she doesn't want me to be disappointed. I try telling her that it is your body, your health, and your decision to make. If that is how you choose to cope, I understand. If anyone has recommendations for this conversation, I would appreciate it. I refuse to enable this habit and encourage her to use nicotine to cope, but I refuse to stop her from doing what she wants. I am fully supportive of her making these decisions for herself and I encourage her to not worry about what I think. She needs to do what she thinks is best. I just don't know how to support her anymore or what to say. Thank you for any input. Hey there! It sounds like you're in a tough spot. You're doing great by supporting your girlfriend through this. Let her know you're proud of her progress without vaping and that you'll support her no matter what. Encourage her to find healthier ways to cope with stress. Keep reminding her that your love is unconditional. It might take time, but being patient and understanding will help her make the best decision for herself. [Practical Advice]"
"Just got into dating apps..I have no idea what I'm doing on there lol. 

I liked this guy and he liked me back which means he matched me, but no text. Am I supposed to text first? Does it matter? The app is hinge btw 

And why the heck are people blurred on apps like bumble and tinder? If they like me and I can't see anything about their profile then I'm not going to like back..but is that how it's supposed to work? so it doesn't matter who messages first on hinge. You can message first or you can wait for the guy to message first. However, I don't see any harm for you to message first if you're really interested in him. As for the blurring on Tinder and hinge, it's done on purpose to get you to pay for the app. The business model of those types of apps is that they want people to get burned out by having to swipe continuously, so that you give up and pay to see who's already liked them. Hinge and FB dating are the only apps that I know of where you can see who's liked your profile. [Commentator's opinion]"
"So my boyfriend (24M) and I (24F) have been together for 2 months and we live 2 1/2 hours away. We both live with our parents and don’t have our own place. 

It sucks when the distance isn’t that far but far enough where we can’t be intimate with one another. The only thing we can do is book a hotel room but that becomes costly. Any advice on where else we can be intimate at that won’t be costly?

"I (23f) have been seeing this guy (26m) for about a month and a half. We hang out 3-4 times a week, talk a bit, have hooked up, and he acts like we are in a relationship. well, i decided to ask the “so what are we” question and he said:

“If you want to know how I feel, i definitely like you and enjoy your company always. As far as what I’m looking for, I told you before that in the past I’ve always jumped from relationship to relationship and I’m really hoping I don’t do that this time. I’m not ready to give someone my 100% undivided attention just yet, just because I’ve never given myself that kind of attention. I’m truly looking to become the best version of myself before i commit to someone honestly. I’ll tell you right now i don’t talk to any other girls nor am i looking to talk to anyone else. If this were any other time in my life I would’ve already asked you to be my girlfriend but I’m not the type to do something unless I know I can put 100% effort in and there’s just so much I’m still figuring out about myself.”

How do i even respond to this? I’m fine with waiting, but i don’t want to be putting in all this effort and time be strung along for no reason. idk how to convey this in a way that doesn’t seem bitchy, i feel like just outwardly saying that won’t sound right, ya know? he’s a great guy and i enjoy the time we spend together, but i don’t want to hurt myself in the long run, so i know it’s better to get clarity now. 

Idk how to even respond to this ugh. help. what would you do? :( The problem is that the words and actions do not align and is confusing and frustrating. 
Step back in the relationship so that what you are doing matching what he says he wants/can give you and ask him to do the same. After the initial adjustment to it, if that process of differentiation or stepping back feels unmanageable or undesirable, then that’s the end. 

It might also help for you all to discuss what being “in a relationship” looks like and means to each of you. Like how does what’s happening now differ from whatever the next step is? [Practical Advice]"
"I’m going to try my best to explain my situation here, so sorry if this is very long. I (20m) have been talking to this girl (19f) for a few weeks that I met at work. We seemed to get along very well and eventually we went out to a coffee place one day and we stayed for a few hours and I felt it went well. However, that day she did tell me that she is bi, which isn’t a problem, I just didn’t expect it, and I have never talked to anyone who is bi before. I am saying this because I feel like it has an effect on the current situation. A few days later we went to an MLB game together and she told me afterwards via text that she had a lot of fun, and I said I did as well. We never actually put a label on the times we went out, I have no idea what she thinks of me or if she saw those as dates or just 2 friends hanging out. I was afraid to break the touch barrier because I don’t know what she would do, I thought about it, but I didn’t, she wasn’t dropping any obvious hints.  We were talking about going to Six Flags together in the coming weeks, and I messaged her a day later to talk about that because I did research about it. She usually takes kind of a while to respond so we were trying to figure it out over the next few days and then she just stopped responding to my texts the other day. However, she still snaps me (half/full face pics) and has been doing it for a few days now. I haven’t seen her in person since the game, but I think we both work together this week a few times so I’ll see her then. Is she avoiding talking to me because she’s unsure about what to do?  Is she slowly pulling away because she thought I would make a move? I don’t feel like I did anything wrong, I need advice on what to do. I would prefer a relationship, but I am totally ok with just being friends if she doesn’t want that because I think she’s a cool person. When I see her this week I’m planning to just talk to her normally. I just wish I knew how she felt about this whole thing. Any advice would be appreciated. Shoutout to everyone who read the whole thing.  If she is still snapping you then why don’t you snap her & ask her. Take a pic of something from a night you both hung out, type something like “ had a fun time, perhaps we can go on another date? “ you are being direct cause  according to you there was no signs (could be bad but not necessarily). 

If you see her at work maybe ask her out, walk up to her when she is not busy & say “ I enjoyed myself last time with you, would you want to go out Friday?” 

Here is my point ….. if you don’t do anything you will never know or you will always wonder.  Just take a deep breath & be yourself, be direct and follow with the above. 

No matter if she is BI you can still ask , worst case she say that she is not interested but at least you know. 

Best of luck 🤞 to you, always stay positive and always take any opportunities or chances that you deem positive in your life.

"She broke up with me a day ago, and I know it’s normal to be feeling physical and mental symptoms from the breakup. I think the only thing keeping me from imploding is the hope I have that she might come back. She said that the reason we broke up was because after I was gone for two weeks, she had the realization that she missed me more like a friend than a boyfriend, and that she had been feeling like that for a few weeks now that she looked back. She was having panic attacks the day and night before we broke up, and she said it was partially because she was thinking about breaking up. She said that she didn’t feel the deep comfort level that she feels people like her close friends and that it is something that somebody either feels or they don’t. She said that I deserved better. I thought we were going strong and we had even planned to see each other twice this coming week 2 days prior to the breakup. It caught me very off guard, as I was starting to let my guard down from being hurt when I finally started thinking about the future with people. We dated for about 2 months and a little over a week. We are both entering our senior year of high school. I also feel like we were just getting out of the honeymoon phase, but I don’t think she is experienced enough in relationships to understand that as I was her first. We were both crying on the call when we broke up. I thought we actually could’ve been something. Is there any chance she will change her mind? If there is a chance, how long should I hope for her to text me again before I send out my own hail mary(I will no matter what for my own peace)? Or should I even see if we could meet up in person for some in person closure/reconciliation attempt(we live ~45min apart)?

Extra: When she broke up with me I didn’t try to save the relationship or reason with her. I was just in shock and accepted it while spilling my left over feelings. This is going to be a tough pill to swallow but you need to be thankful she had the courage to break up with you. So many people nowadays just start cheating when things aren’t working out in their relationship. She was brave enough to let you know how she was feeling. If you really love her, you have to let her go. Send her a text and tell her how much you enjoyed your time together, and that you won’t forget it, and that you wish for her happiness in the future. Thank her for giving you a chance, and tell her how meaningful it was even though it didn’t work out. And after that you need to move on my dude. Don’t hold out hope, you’ll just hurt yourself. This stuff’s never easy. Everything will remind you of her, you just have to let go. Find someone new and think about what you can learn from this experience. Best of luck dude! [Emotional Support]"
"So we met about 1-2 times but we got eachother contact, we text alot in the first month, things going great, she seems to like it and we talk alot but in the second month it get repetitive so I tried to ask her out, go have a dinner or something, I thought she gonna agree but she's not. I didn't even say this was a date, just have a dinner as a friend.

After that I ask her out a couple more times throughout the week but she still don't want to go, I start to think ""Am I really that bad that even a friend don't want to meet me?"". It's not like she is busy all the time, I saw she's still hangout with her friends alot but just not me.

So now should I keep continue to text her daily  and wait for another chance or just done with this weird relationship and move on? STOP TEXTING HER. She is using you for attention, move on. There’s plenty of girls that will actually wanna go out with you, she isn’t one of them. [Practical Advice]"

"Me 19F and my friend 19NB, have been friends since middle school. Its been twice since they made a move on me and I rejected them. But they still make me uncomfortable like them being like, “It’s so weird because I love people that I’ve known for so long. Even if I can’t be with them... Like I’m in love with their soul.. blah blah...” 
It sucks really bad because I feel like they only like me because I’m a girl. Like if I was a guy, this wouldn’t be a problem. But I don’t know if I’m overthinking it. Should I distance myself? I don’t want to lose them as a best friend.

TLDR: Best friend possibly in love with me. Should I confront ? Should I just ignore ? Or distance myself. They have to come to terms and accept you’re not interested 

It’s not your resizability to “do” anything just because they have feelings and you…don’t 

That said, distancing yourself would probably do more damage than help and if as you say you don’t want to lose them as a friend, that’s a sure fire way to do exactly that 😐

You still may, if they really *cannot* separate their unrequited feelings for you from your friendship, but that won’t be anything you can do about and there’s not really anything you can do in that 

What happens long term is up to them, all you can really do I suppose is to keep being their friend the same as you would if they weren’t possibly harboring feelings for you 

What they do is up to them [Commentator's opinion]"
"I have (29m) a 2yr old toddler with my girlfriend (23f). My girlfriend has a twin sister who lives a delusional life with no accountability whatsoever. She is also in an abusive relationship with her fiancé (31m) who she is going to marry soon. They also have a 2 yr old toddler as well. 

The fiancé is not only abusive towards my gf sister but he has cursed out there mom and threatened there little brother (12m) in the past year or so. He threatened my girlfriend because she refused to watch their 2 yr old after he had got into an argument with her sister. He told her in a text message that “I will slap the shit out of you and your bf bitch, fuck you and everybody around you”. And proceed to block her number. We did not see him for a very long time until recently the sister invited us to their 2 year olds party.

At his daughter’s party I did not speak to him the entire time. He spoke to everyone but me. Party ended and we didn’t see her sister and him again until Memorial Day. Even after the disrespect the mom decided to invite him over because she is a “forgiving Christian woman” as my gf would say. The entire time at the house, this guy did not speak to me neither once did he even look my way. We all sat at the dinner table and ate and he was very quiet..almost like he didn’t want to be there. I can tell he felt really uncomfortable. Eventually it ended and we didn’t see the fiancé and her sister again until their older sister’s birthday party. And again he spoke to everybody but me. He doesn’t even talk to my gf really, he just say “hi” and that’s it.

Couple day’s ago, my gf sister randomly invites herself and her fiancé over with there toddler. Our kids are pretty close to each other. My gf said “No” she would not like them to come over because she does not like her fiancé, she said her sisters entire attitude switched from happy to offended. I don’t speak to this guy at all and he does not speak to me either. And the sister knows this but still seems to be forcing a relationship , that will never exist. Her sister is oblivious to his actions. She always uses phrases like “the past is the past” and she and him are good at playing victim too.

I can’t control who is at their mom’s house but, I can control who I am around and who comes into my home. I find it very disturbing how the sister overlooks his behavior and does not address him at all about his behavior. Are the sister and the fiancé worth addressing? Any advice? You and your gf are right to instill boundaries. Don't let him into your house. He is violent. [Practical Advice]"
"We have been dating for six years. I love him very much and he is my best friend. We only see each other on the weekends when we are home from university. We either meet at his parents or my parents house and sleep together there. He is very good looking and really sweet. I often get the urge to hug/kiss/touch him but not much more than that. I do sometimes feel sexually attracted to him but it is rare. He is very attracted to me. I am capable of being sexually attracted to men. And do feel sexually attracted to other men, but i immediately let those thoughts go and would never be unfaithful, i just mean i do feel natural sexual attraction sometimes. I think i might have a weird relationship with sex. I feel like it is shameful and feel like love is and should be innocent and cute. Therefore maybe i feel like love and lust don’t go together in my head.  
Does anyone have any tips for this problem, or any explanations/theories? 
 This is going to be beyond Reddit’s pay grade. It sounds like you have some complex feelings about sex and love that are hindering your relationship. Talking about that with a therapist would be a great place to start, and something that could help a lot. [Practical Advice]"

"I’ve had good partners in the past (fair household split and mental load is discussed) so it’s not like I am doing all the work. It’s just that I can’t focus on myself, when I am living with someone else in terms of organization and it feels like my whole world surrounds them. 

I’ve been with my partner for 4 years now, living together for 3 1/2 years and we’ve worked a lot on ourselves to get to a really healthy and good relationship. 

What bothers me is that I feel like it takes so much mental work to focus on myself everyday. I feel like I am super dependent on what he does/when he’s around and the only time I ever feel in control is when he’s out of town and I have our place to myself. That’s always the time when I feel like I am getting a total glow-up (working out, having a routine, cooking & eating healthy)

I’ve grown up with a mother who gave her whole life up to „built“ her husband and be the woman behind. She is to this day pretty unhappy about her life choices and I try to always remember to not live and burn for somebody else. 

I also was recently diagnosed with adhd and high functioning autism, he has adhd (not sure if this matters). 

Another important thing to add is that I’ve felt like this with every person I’ve dated/been in a relationship so I think this is a me-problem.

Does anybody have advice/thoughts on this or similar experiences? I want to live for myself, I am in therapy and will address this topic, but right now I just feel lost and could use some perspective. Relationships aren’t all the same and sometimes they’re not for everyone. Maybe you’d be fine in a relationship with someone who also strongly values their “me” time which balances out everything. Maybe you’re better off not being in a relationship at all. 

If you believe the relationship is fairly healthy, all things considered, and you’re feeling this way, it may be time to discuss this with your partner. Let him know you need more time for yourself. Get his response and see where things go from there. [Practical Advice]"
"I am dating a guy that I have known for 3 months. He is extremelly close with a female friend from another country that he met online while gaming 3 years ago. He travelled to her country to visit her 2 years ago and yesterday he told me they also travelled together to another country . She travelled to his country (where we live) too. It all happened around 1.5 years ago. It's also important to add that he has recently told me that she recently came out as a lesbian and in the past he has also told me that he has only ever had sex with 1 person, his ex GF of 10 years

He gave me the impression that him and this female friend talk every day and are very close to each other. Now I fear that they may have had something, or that him at least had feelings for her. I don't know if I should ask him about this or not... I don't want to be the replacement because he could not have a relationship with her due to the distance or something else. I don't want to be that.

What should I do? 
 Why does it matter if it was 1.5 yrs ago? He already told you he has only slept with 1 person which was not this person. She is lesbian so probably not interested in sleeping with your bf. Are you just worried about him being so emotionally connected to another person? Nothing he has done matters unless you have trust issues or insecurities that will cause you mental distress over him being friends with another woman. Keep in mind half the world is the opposite gender. [Commentator's opinion]"
"Whats up, I just met a girl on fb dating and we have been talking for about 5 days now. In the beginning (which I know is fast, I thought we clicked right away) we were flirting and getting to know each other. She said she liked me, her best friend approved of me, I thought it was kicking off to a great start. She came over to my house on the 2nd day, and we hung out and talked. She had a great time, things got a little spicy, but we didn't sleep together. After she left, I told her I had a great time, she said she did too . I mentioned something about hanging out again and she said she would like that, so the next day, I asked her if there was a day where her kid could be watched and we could go get dinner. She said don't know, and texted me later saying that she doesn't think we were gonna work out, and that we had nothing in common. I asked her if she wanted to talk and see where it goes and she said sure. I wasn't trying to rush anything, im just very confused. I've never been interested with someone who has these symptoms, and we are still talking through out the day just not like we were before. Did I screw up somewhere? Am I wasting my time? I'm so confused, she said I was awesome and I had her laughing her ass off the whole time. Any advice is appreciated Thought I add that she said she wanted us to work, just wasn't feeling a connection. Said she wasn't a 100%. She has had terrible previous relationships, im just not sure how to continue this in the right direction to be with her [Not Relevant]"
"I’m a 36M and gf is 32F. Been together almost 8 years. Throughout the years I’ve dealt with episodes of her throwing rage fits. The first time I dealt with it was in year two of dating. We got into an argument at a friend’s wedding, but it was so long ago I don’t even remember what it was about. We stayed overnight in our private bedroom and she punched me in the chest 3 times because she was so mad at something I said. I was shook. Like holy shit, did I just experience domestic abuse for the first time in my life? She apologized, we made up and moved on. There have been 3 other incidents where her rage has taken over since then. Slamming doors, punching through a window and shattering the glass is one of them. Multiple doors slammed and screaming at the top of her lungs. Each time I’ve walked out of the house and didn’t come back for 2-3 days. She hasn’t laid her hands on me since that first incident. This is all over the span of almost 8 years. 

Her Mom passed in year 4. I was a pallbearer. We’ve gone through a lot in our relationship. I’ve hoped for change, but this past week she blew up again. This time it was about her own personal work life. She exploded and went on a rageful rampage and shattered our bedroom window by punching it. Luckily she didn’t cut herself. 

She’s gone to therapy to cope with the passing of her mom. She’s tried to self medicate with pot. She has no close friends where we live. Nothing has helped. I’ve found myself being her therapist, psychiatrist, psychologist, best friend, etc…I’m EXHAUSTED. We’ve been discussing potentially breaking up. It’s so hard right now. I’m confused. Investing so much time and so many years in a relationship, and now considering breaking up is baffling. We’re at a crossroads. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Any advice would be much appreciated. you have to leave. **You have to fucking leave**. There is no ""discussion"" about potentially breaking up, you have to DO IT.

"Me (23M) and my partner (23F) have been together for 7 months now. Lately, she's been acting a bit distant and cold. Then yesterday, she opened up to me about something bothering her. It seems like she's unsure about getting married in the future or becoming dependent on her spouse. She mentioned she might prefer being independent down the road and isn't sure if she wants us to get married eventually or if she wants to marry me. She assured me she's not leaving, but it's left me feeling uncertain about where our relationship is heading. Maybe she just needs some time to figure things out. Now I'm anxious, wondering if our relationship might end or if she's thinking about marrying someone else.



I'm starting to worry that maybe she's interested in someone else, especially since most of her close friends and coworkers are guys from her workplace. I'm not sure what to do or how to process all of this.



She also mentioned she wants to be alone in the future so she can hang out and bond more with her friends. But right now, she already spends time with them and her coworkers. I'm not sure if that's really the reason or if there's more to it. I'm just feeling confused by everything she's said. [deleted] [Not Relevant]"
"My boyfriend [21M] of 2.5 years rung me [22F] on the phone yesterday and admitted that he got a handjob from a masseuse in Bali on their boys trip. They have been there for the past week and this happened the first night they got there, I only found it yesterday (5 days later after it happened). He went with 3 of his friends, 2 of which are in relationships with girls who are close friends of mine, one who is my housemate. 2 of them got blowjobs but my boyfriend only got a handjob, or so he says. They had been drinking all day at a beach club and apparently walked past it on the way home. The two other girlfriends know what happened aswell. 

I’m feeling conflicted and although he’s extremely remorseful, the idea of it all just makes me uncomfortable and sick. Keep in mind they also paid quite a bit of money to get this done. I don’t know if this is bad enough for me to break it off because I do truly love him and he has never given me another reason to not trust him. Breakup and rat them all out.

They knew what they were doing.

"So i struggle a little with following up on girls making a move on me... either because i believe they are just being friendly or because i do not want to seem creepy.

I'm a 6"" tall Caucasian bachelor from germany in my early 30s with good career and fitness and i would say, overall attractive. On occasions i am being approached by women who ask for things or just strike a conversation with me. I am now finally smart enough to understand that this is indeed a sort of ""invitation"" - (took me way too long to figure that out, i know...)

Anyway, i am a timid person although not shy at all... but i can be socially a little awkward. Even when they obviously flirt with me or make excuses to touch me, i am not quite sure how to respond. Apparently, i have never had a healthy role-model if it comes to ""boundaries"" and what sort of ""risk"" is appropriate to cross them.

Its totally different once we get to know each other however and have some thing going already... usually its absolute smooth sailing from there.... i do not get there a lot though because i believe i am being too ""respectful"" maybe. Does that make sens?

As a ""successful"" man reading this - i would just love some general advice on how you do it.

I am open about my feelings more often than not, in a healthy, communicative way. Other than that i would identify as stoic. Not sure if this actually a thing that turns women off or on... probably depending on the girl tho. I am mostly dating women in their mid 20s and keep respectful distance to divorced women or single-mothers. I would like children of my own but am fine with casual relationships. This...struck very close to home for me.

Couple things,

1. consider therapy. I believe everyone can benefit from therapy and it might help shed some light on some things you haven't addressed. This is especially helpful when it comes to setting and figuring out your boundaries. I've been in therapy for 2 years (30M), and it's been a slow process but I feel like I'm more aware of things affecting me, and have some more tools to help.
2. If someone initiates physical touch, mirror it. If they touch your arm, touch theirs and, maybe, escalate a little. Touch further up their arm, move closer and see if they pull away when your legs touch.
3. If you think someone is flirting, smile and make eye contact, see what they're reaction is. [Practical Advice]"
"I'll try my best to explain, so I had a interest of sorts in my partner for a good 2 months before I got asked out, the problem is looking back on it now I don't know if it was romantic or not. I have always been a bit of an emotionless person for as long as I have known and the few emotions I have felt I never really understood what they were. But despite that I said yes when I was asked out. And at first I didn't sense anything off about how I felt until my partner talked about joining me in my plans for the future i.e moving to a different country and such. I felt really apprehensive/strange about it, though it didn't seem out of character since my partner is a very affectionate and overall genuine soul. So a bit later my partner and I had a film date and he was hugging me and kissed me on the cheek. This made me very awkward because I don't like physical affection, I used to be really bad and especially around hugs, I had a friend hug me once and I physically felt repulsed/shivered and then afterwards I felt like throwing up. Then my partner and I were messaging and they mentioned missing me and wanting to see me soon again, I couldn't because I was jam packed and had no time. A good while later they mentioned it again and made a dramatization of just how much they wanted to see me. And I realized at that point that I didn't feel a need to be around them like that and that I was ok with not seeing him for extended periods of time because messages were good enough. With this realization, I came to have another one and that was that I don't think I feel anything when I look at them while they look at me as if I'm their world (as some of my observer friends said). I wanted some advice so I don't prolong a relationship that just has someone putting all their love and effort into it only for it to not be reciprocated no matter how hard I try. The thing is I don't want to disappoint him or the people who care about him. Stop delaying the inevitable and just break up with him!! [Practical Advice]"
"I met my 31m coworker and started talking to him about 2-3 months ago…. We got very close or at least I thought we did he came over a couple of times to my apartment and took me out to eat twice. We never had sex but we did almost everything else. Had phone calls texted almost everyday and I got so attached. Recently he’s been blocking me from seeing his stories and he blocked me on instagram when we didn’t even have each other on there in the first place. We are still each others #1 friends on Snapchat if that means anything at all. But he hasn’t spoken to me in the last two days. I miss him and have to see him everyday at work for probably the next 2 years. Please if you have any advice I’d truly appreciate it and please don’t be rude as I’m already hurt.  The first piece of advice I’d give is to say that conventional wisdom will suggest that you don’t shit where you eat. Why? Because of what you’re dealing with right now. Your professional relationship will (if it isn’t already) almost certainly be negatively impacted but here’s hoping that’s not the case. 

Regardless, assuming you’ll ignore all that (realizing we’re also past that point anyway), what you need to do is use your words. Tell him how you feel and what you want. 

He hasn’t spoken to you in two days? Have you reached out to him? Next, how do you know you’re blocked? Did you look on another account?

Either way, talk to him. That’s how you’ll get the answer you need. Good luck. [Practical Advice]"
"He and I have been together for almost 8 years now, and this has been an ongoing problem the whole time. The main problem to me is I can’t bring up concerns without him arguing with how I feel, getting defensive, making excuses, blaming me, or turning the tables on me. 

For example, he and I were gaming together and something he was doing was kind of bothering me a little so I decided to ask him his preferred way to go about that thing so I could adjust. In a game we like to play together, looting is a great way to get coin and supplies. Bits and bobs. He often cuts me off in the game to loot where I was trying to go. Kind of annoying but no big deal. So I asked him if he’d prefer to do all the looting and I can do other stuff in the meantime.  He took exception to that, huffed, and asked me what my problem was. I didn’t want to fight so I said that. It really wasn’t a big deal and I didn’t want it to turn into one. He responded by telling me he’s sick of me painting him out to be the bad guy and like his existence is annoying and a burden. 

This sort of things happens every single time I bring up a concern with him. No matter how benign. No matter how delicately I put it.  If it’s not super fun for him to hear, he takes it personally. Like I attacked him and now we’re enemies. Every. Single. Time. Without fail. 


I’ve told him (ad nauseam) that I should be able to bring up concerns and it not turn into a fight. He agrees and promises to do better next time. He doesn’t. Ever. And I’m not exaggerating. It hasn’t gotten even a little better over this 8 years. He’s spiteful and disingenuous and disrespectful during these unfun conversations when all I’m trying to do is just tell him how I feel. 


I know at this point I’m a fool in love. I know he’s shown me time and time again who he is and how he handles things. And yet, I stay. Hoping it will get better, knowing it won’t. What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I leave him? How do I show myself I deserve better? Why cant I effing leave?? I think your question ""why can't I leave the repeated DARVo, dismissive unhappy relationship"" is large enough to warrant professional help/advice; like individual therapy or at least family

I sense being dismissed and talked down to like a bully, and even if I was getting paid to play my favorite games I wouldn't put up with such an immature churlish ""teammate"" like that. I'd play with randos instead

He learned you won't leave and he doesn't have to pretend to respect or care for you.  

You feel comfortable, like it isn't *terrible*.. yet.  But are you really happy, now? You deserve respect and love, consistently. Not to be nitpicked when they feel moderately held accountable for bullying words.

Alternate, bad advice: 

 if you're unsure that it's merely uncomfortable, introduce him to a mirror of his own experience. Call and treat him the way he does to you, write it off, laugh about him loudly in front of his peer gamers, and see him take it in stride or fully change (protip: it won't) [Emotional Support]"
"My(31 F) partner(47 M) and I have been dating for a little bit over a year now. We got engaged (unofficially) 2 months ago. Some of my family and almost all of my friends now about it, he said he will tell his family closer to and when we have an actual wedding date. My OH, has a 7 yo son from past relationship which he spends time every school break-I have been seeing and spending time with his son as well those times his son is with us as we also have been living together like 10 months now. So my partner told me he was going to tell his son about us getting married, and I was nervous but then excited that he was going to tell this important event to one and if not, to the most important person in his life. Fast forward, he hasn’t already told his son yet. So I opened this up last night about me feeling insecure about us my partner said his son and I gets along well, he thinks there wouldn’t be an issue and he said 100% this has nothing to do with us but all to do with the timing to tell his son. Well a week ago, he casually asked his son hey son do you want us to be together in a long time? And his 7 year old said yes. So as much as I want to be understanding, I really don’t see why he couldn’t just tell his son hey, well were getting married. The last thing my partner said to me last night is that he wants to be 100 sure as he cant take it back. Uhmm I think to me that’s more to do with him being unsure about us and has nothing to do with his son? Thoughts? I don't think anyone can really say when its an appropiate time besides the parent of the child.

Yes, his child is about to become yours once your married.

But this is a situation he is navigating with his child. I think you should give him a bit more faith as he's trying to do it in a way that he considers best. [Commentator's opinion]"
"For some background, I (20F) have never had a boyfriend since I've always been happy on my own. When it comes to dating, I don't have a strong interest in in pursuing one and kinda have a ""if it happens, it happens"" mentality around it. For the past 7-ish weeks, I started talking and hanging out with a guy from my apartment complex after meeting him at a party since we had a few artsy hobbies in common. 

I let him know in the beginning that I've never had a boyfriend and wasn't comfortable with anything fast-paced, so we have been keeping things mostly casual (just some cuddling), and unfortunately, I'm just not feeling it. Seeing as that I've never really had romantic feelings, I quite literally have no idea what they feel like, so I have been pushing to see if I maybe I feel something. 

After a lifetime of feeling this way, I'm slowly realizing that it's time for some self-reflection to explore the possibility that I'm aromantic or ace. However, I feel horrible about the whole thing. He suffers from anxiety and depression and has also confessed to me that he has Aspergers and that he struggles a lot with being lonely. I tried to hold out to see if I just develop feelings slower, and to see if some of the social awkwardness attributed with his Aspergers would lessen as he became more comfortable with me, but neither has been the case. I'm finding more and more that regardless of whatever my confusing feelings are, we just aren't that compatible and that there are very uneven levels of attraction. He constantly wants to hang out and when we do, I do 80% of the communication and just there isn't much flow to it. 

I've had to let men down before, but I'm struggling for this scenario because 1) How long we've been talking, 2) The fact that I actually may not experience romantic/sexual attraction to men, and 3) How much he's both directly and indirectly vocalized his desire for a girlfriend. I just need to tell him in person the next time we meet, what do you think is the best way to not hurt him? There isn’t really a way to not hurt him as it seems he’s already developed some level of attachment, but the sooner the better, best course is to try to just be nice about it and let him down easy, but make sure you’re clear that there is no romantic attraction on your part, you have the option of exploring friendship but just know that his attachment to you romantically will likely not go away and all I can speak on with that is my experience and for my longterm mental wellbeing it was better when as a teenager if the person didn’t recipreciprocate romantic feelings that they were upfront about it and kept contact to a minimum afterwards, I feel like this guy will want to keep in contact platonically and ultimately then you will have to decide what’s best for you.

"So I met with this guy overseas as part of a tour that he was a guide for, we clicked and it was an instant connection.

Fast forward, he contacted me on Whatsapp and we spoke for two weeks and everything was fine. Checking on me multiple times a day, quick replies, we briefly saw each other outside my hotel a few times coz I was there with my fam.

We decided to meet a day before my flight back home and things happened between us, it was just perfect. He was good and acted like a gentleman, wanted me to stay in his country for long term or plans about him coming to visit me etc.

However, since I landed back home, his behaviour has changed very cold towards me. He took hours to reply or sometimes a whole day and that too, only two messages in 24 hours. Have I been played? How do I confront him? If that’s all what he wanted, why does he still messages me? Sorry.. you have been played. Next trick might be that “he’s in trouble and needs to borrow money” Cut your loss and move on.. treat this as a learning experience. [Practical Advice]"
"I (19f) met this guy (21m) at a bar last summer and we’ve been talking for almost a year now. I started at college last year so it was obvious our relationship wasn’t going anywhere at the time but we did talk some throughout the school year. On top of that- he is in the military and is only stationed in my area he literally lives across the country. This summer since I’ve been back we have been hanging out like 3 days a week and sleeping over with each-other like 3 days a week. We go on “dates” being movies baseball games really casual dinners stuff like that- almost friend activities. Physically it hasn’t gone very far- we make out, cuddle, I give him head and he has fingered me but that’s it. He hasn’t brought up a future between us and I can tell he views our relationship as really casual. 

My dilemma is we are both anticipating sex but I have never had sex with someone I have an emotional connection to; only with random club guys I see once. I fear that if we do, I will become attached and would have to deal with that emotional baggage when I leave again for college. Is it wise just to avoid sex for the next two months and just keep it as casual as possible? I want to be more intimate but I have a feeling it’s going to make things more painful for me in the end- especially at this point in our “relationship” . Help. (24 M) I personally wouldn’t have sex unless I am in a serious relationship bc I’ve had sex quite recently with someone I was talking to and I got attached and realized our personalities weren’t compatible. I had to end things today bc of that and bc I was attached bc of the sex and our intimate time. All that to say. Save it for someone you are actually dating [Commentator's opinion]"
"Recently started seeing this girl I met on a dating app (we’re both 21). When we first started talking I was confident she liked me, we would have text conversations until 2am and had good chemistry on the first date. However, lately I’m feeling like I’m getting mixed signals. I’m very shy so I haven’t really made any overt physical contact moves but I’ve been trying to kinda lightly touch her and see how she reacts. On our second date she wasn’t pulling away at all, but now on our third date today it seemed like she was pulling away abt half the time I tried to get close to her. Not certain tho, I’m really bad at reading body language which is why I havent rlly made any moves (not even holding her hand). She also takes a long time to respond to texts when she never used to, even when ik she’s on her phone bc she posts on her story. But she also still texts back (eventually), isn’t dry, texts first, and keeps agreeing to dates (and yes, I am being careful to explicitly call them dates). And on dates conversations seem to flow well and have a somewhat flirty vibe (mutual teasing). 

So basically I was wondering if I should just straight up text her “hey do you like me” bc honestly it’s kinda just driving me insane to think about. Or would that be weird and potentially risk giving her the ick lmao.

"I [30 M] met this girl [25 F] at work.  From the beginning we had a really great relationship (not romantically), a lot of common jokes and topics for conversation. But we didn't go out with each other outside of work (apart from one time to a place we both liked). I recently found out that she is taking a long leave of absence, after which she does not return to work. I thought this might be my last chance, so I invited her to the place where we first went out after work.  She agreed.  We had a really great time, she told me about herself and her future plans (we hadn't even shared such information before). The next day she texted me to ask how much money she had to pay me back for yesterday. I said he didn't have to give anything back. Then we exchanged a few messages and now she's silent. The problem is that from the moment she first wrote, the average time for her to respond is 24 hours. She supposedly told me that she had a lot on her mind in the near future: a friend's wedding or a vacation with her parents, but in my head I had a sentence that was usually true: if someone likes you, that person will always find time for you.

I'm confused now. Is this some kind of hot and cold treatment or she's simply not interested? Maybe I'm just overthinking?

Any intelligent advice and feedback is welcomed and appreciated. Thanks!  You're trying to have a relationship through your phone. It doesn't work. She'll just meet someone who impresses her in real life.  [Commentator's opinion]"

At 26, I don’t see how this will happen otherwise.  I could feign attraction to a desperate woman who doesn’t take care of herself but that seems even worse.  Or I could date significantly younger women (20-21) but that also seems kind of exploitative.

I’ve made multitudes of attempts to get to know women and then ask them out, only to get rejected for inexperience.  So I’m planning on paying for it, just ONCE to get it out of the way.

If it’s a huge turn-off, then I know I have to hide it as well. All I can say is I think there's way more stigma against using a prostitute than there is against being a virgin [Commentator's opinion]"
"I’m just shocked rn… i’m 24… this guy told me he was 27. He just admitted that he’s 33. what? I’m not a fucking 18 year old, i’m 24. and he still lied about his age. 

It’s not an age gap at all, but i’m just shocked. He’s a bit weird too. I think i’m going to “end things”. 

He said that he lied about his age because “old people” like him get rejected a lot due to their age. What? 

if he lied about his age, he can lie about anything else

I’m pretty upset right now, not going to lie. 

whatever though. I feel like ghosting him. he even said, “don’t hate me, please” 

such bullshit… 

EDIT: but should i just ghost him, block him and move on,  or just say goodbye to him? 

2nd edit: Damn, this blew up. i ghosted him, but I might send him a goodbye message tomorrow or the next day. 

I’m just upset, because I really like the way he was/is. Except for the fact that he’d want to talk about sex mostly all the time and would ask for nudes often. 🤦‍♀️ “i can’t wait to fuck you” “i’m going to destroy your pussy” “i want to have you with me already” “once i have enough money, i’ll fly out to see you” “Even if we don’t connect i’ll still gladly live with you so we can be friends with benefits” 

he even had the audacity to say “since everything is going well between us, i must admit that I don’t want any lies between us. so the truth is, i lied to you about my age. i’m 33” 🤦‍♀️  If I were in your position, I'd send ""Lying about your age is a deal breaker for me.

"My GF (18F) and I (18M) have been together officially for a year and about 2 years unofficially. First, I have to admit my GF did say that she doesn't enjoy physical touch that much. For example we haven't kissed yet because she finds kissing 'disgusting and weird,' I've accepted it and I'm okay with that. 

We do have moments of physical touch but I initiate it only, like holding hands and fondling. Even so when we're hanging out at my house she doesn't sit close me (I have to move over towards her) We've talked about it and she says that she doesn't necessarily 'love' the physical touch but she's **okay** with it. 

Also, we're not very good at communicating. I find it very hard to talk to her about being more physically intimate (and just more personal things about myself in general) For example when we talk about more personal things she changes the subject quickly. 

What should I do? Should I try to talk to her? Just tough it out? Or start thinking about the end of the relationship? Personally, I feel guilty about wanting more physical affection and that I shouldn't want it since she isn't keen on it.

tldr: My GF isn't a very physically affectionate person and I'm not sure how to get more physical affection. (or if i should) I suggest that you better talk with her seriously first, maybe she just this type of a person who don't like being physical but maybe it's something more deep, idk
But conversation it's always a good start and after you can think if there something you together can do to make  it feel more comfortable for you and her, or rather it's will be better to end the relationship [Practical Advice]"

"  
I 29F am pregnant and have been only dating my fiance 34M for a year. We are getting married and things are going good . Due to some bad history I avoided dating and he was my first. The guy is an airline pilot and gone for 17 days a month, which is fine  for my avoidant attachment style. He is good looking, smart and gets along with my family. Yet at a family event recently he got sooo drunk, he actually arrived dizzy, and told my cousin some very unkind things about his girlfriend. He called her a sl\*t (she is known for her past of sleeping around in this small community) and warned him that her fat a(ss) will get even fatter after she delivers a baby. Then he said that ""his woman has only been with him and even after she gives him a buunch of kids will not look old or gain weight"". Now, his woman is me. I found the wording very mean. And also to give him kids. Like a kid is something a wife give to her man?

I don't know what to think about all  his. He was soo drunk that he spent the night on all fours vomiting in the toilet. My cousin put him in the car and took him to my place. And now some  memories come to my mind. I am fit as I hit the gym daily. But during winter I gain a bit of a weight. He was not mean or anything but bought me some jeans that were small, to motivate me lose weight. He said it was a joke but not sure. Also, I am an elementary school teacher and I thought about changing the career for an office job. He wasn't against it but he said elementary school teacher is very nice for a woman. I had a talk with him again, at breakfast. I told him for me it was a big deal what he said and I don't accept to NOT talk about it. I was pretty firm I would say. He acted surprised. I noticed how he stopped his fork near his mouth without putting the food in. But he was open and asked what exactly I want to know. I asked if he thinks women are inferior to men in any way or that our weight is an indicator of our value. I also said I will gain weight during pregnancy. And maybe a lot.

He said he doesn't think women are inferior to men, that he was talking about my cousin's girlfriend, not women in generally. But that he will be honest with me and yes, he wouldn't marry a woman who has a big body count, but added that he doesn't look down upon women who have a high body count, it's just his own preference. He said a lot of women wouldn't date a man who has a low income job or any other criteria. And it's fine. Each to their own. He wouldn't mind marrying a woman who wasn't a virgin, but if she had more than 2, 3 guys up to her 30, then he has a big problem with that and he wouldn't seriously date her. And about the weight he said he doesn't mind that I gain weight during pregnancy, that he was talking about women who stay overweight long after giving birth and use the childbirth as an excuse. I should have felt relieved but I didn't and asked him what if I don't lose the extra weight. He said I will, to not worry about it. But LOL I wasn't worrying about it, I was worried about his view on me. And I confronted him further asking if he will cheat on me if I don't lose weight. He again said I will lose it, it's not a big deal. So I asked him directly: would you, would you cheat on me? He said no [Not Relevant]"
"As the title suggests, I can’t get over a guy I dated over a year ago. We were in a “situationship” for 4 months so he was never even officially my boyfriend. 

Physically, he was everything I was looking for. I was a tan, short, bodybuilding, blonde (22in extensions). He was a 6’4 blue-eyed Italian with luscious locks. I think I was completely infatuated from the start because I told him I loved him after a month of knowing him. 

I kept imaging what it was going to be like when he finally asked me to be his. I made up our entire life story together and fantasized about all day long. I started getting annoyed that he wasn’t asking to be official and it drove me crazy. I started questioning him and begging for reassurance that he was into me. I asked what I needed to change to be with him 

Side note, he was addicted to c**e and op******. I completely dismissed that as an issue because I was so obsessed with him. 

Obviously, things ended horribly. It’s been over a year and I still think about him every day. I try to date, but I always compare people to him (even though he was kind of a loser). 

I need help. Has anyone been through this? Do you have any advice on how I can get over this and actually find someone? The real problem you have is u are looking for a copy of him, That's not gonna happen. You have put him on a pedestal; he was on drugs n overlooked it so who knows what else u over looked also him ticking all your ""list"" boxes doesn't help now your list has a face. 

Proposed solutions: stop using a list as ur Ex is now the list. Start from scratch the only requirements should be you are attracted to them and they are easy to date, kind etc. Eventually real love will win over your infatuation [Practical Advice]"
"I met someone last fall and we went out a couple of times. Both went great, we had lots in common and connected on multiple levels. We kept texting back and forth throughout the winter. I noticed that she would be very responsive and initiating things one moment and then suddenly would go quiet for a while.

We set up another date and then she ended up cancelling at the last minute. After that, I told her I was interested in her but it seemed like she had lost interest, so I was going to move on.

She said that she was in a ten year relationship which ended around 4-5 months before I met her. She had mentioned a past relationship during our second date, but I didn’t realize how long it was or how recent it ended and didn’t want to pry into the details at the time.

She apologized for not being more upfront about it and said that she thinks I’m nice and interesting guy but she realized she’s not ready to date anyone at the moment.

I told her I understand and asked if she wanted to go for a casual walk sometime not as a date. We ended up doing that and she thanked me for being understanding of her situation and said that we’d have to get to know each other as friends for now.

I realize that there is no standard timeline for recovering from a breakup… and even though she’s said she’s interested in me, it’s hard for me to trust it with all the emotions I’ve experienced since I met her.

I’ve tried to go on dates with other women, but I’ve been distracted because I’m thinking about her instead of the woman I’m on the date with.

I feel very stuck at the moment. I’m not sure if I should keep talking to her and inviting her out to do things casually or just move on… hence the Reddit post. Any recommendations?

He said he’d like to make out/grab the ass of 18 year old me. I’m 40f and he’s 41m. I didn’t know how to respond and now I’m definitely creeped out. Would this be a deal breaker for you if a guy said it to you? The guy said he would like to have seen you in your prime. He could’ve used a better age. But it’s not the worst thing he could’ve said. [Commentator's opinion]"
"Basically the title. We had a long talk last night and one of the things he brought up was that he’s slightly less attracted to me now because I’ve gained weight. He referenced a picture he sent me a week ago and said my face looked different now (I assume he means it’s just not as sharp, I have noticed my face looking puffier too). 

When we met I think I was around 115-120 pounds. But now I’m about 135 pounds at 5’3”. I feel conflicted because I have a history of disordered eating and I know I’ve gained weight. I can see it and feel it in my clothes. But yet, I’m happy or the very least accepting of my body and glad with how my life is. And I told him this. I also listed other benefits of my weight gain: I’m no longer as cold even during the summer, my hands and feet aren’t cold all the time either, I have a little shape to my body now too.  

I understand that attraction isn’t something someone can control. My boyfriend treats me great otherwise. He didn’t tell me this begrudgingly but he brought it up in a kind way. But I don’t know how we can navigate this. I told him that I’m not at an unhealthy weight, I think I’m finally not underweight for my height. I’ve had a stressful last three years, and it’s going to be more stressful soon because my mother will be going through chemo (this information he does not know). I know I could tone up to look better but honestly it’s not my priority at the moment. 

I’m surprised that I’m not totally heartbroken by his confession. Instead, I see him slightly different now because my weight gain cause this change in him and that worries me more. I want to have more follow-up conversations but what do I say? How do I spearhead that conversation so our relationship won’t crumble from this? 
 He’s 31 and behaving like this about you gaining weight  even though  you’re still in the healthy range for your size is making you less attractive to him? No leave now. You have to put yourself first especially with your history of disordered eating. As other commenters pointed out, what will he be like if you ever get pregnant? [Emotional Support]"
"Been dating this guy for six months and we had no problems between us. We had been doing long distance but I used to go visit him but he never took me to where he stayed.we always met in town .we had met a few days ago and there was nothing to warn me so I would say the day was good  .the next day some girl calls me and warns me to stay away from this guy and I was so confused. She insulted me and I was too mortified to talk so I just hang up on her. She texts me and all of it was just insults and I was angry so insulted her back. I called the guy the next day and he just said that what the girl said was true .I didn't even cry I just laughed because how much of  a coward was he that he couldn't tell me we were over . He texts me and says she is everything he ever prayed for and I didn't know what to say. I felt bad for a couple of days and talked to some friends and I was over him but now I am scared of ever dating again because I don't want to get hurt.. please advice..
And I still think about this guy sometimes but I don't miss him I just feel a pit in my stomach because I couldn't see the red flags
 > he never took me to where he stayed

Yea, I can ask him, but I just know that my simple questions can easily turn into arguments because he can’t ever simply answer and reassure me. So I want to look him up on my own.

"I 49/F was asked by a friend 32/F to be a bridesmaid in her wedding. I was actually her boss for a few years and we developed a close friendship that has continued for many years along with some mutual friends. She looks up to me and I love her to death. I reluctantly agreed to be in her wedding which is 9 months away. There are 10 bridesmaids. The talk of the bachelorette weekend is happening (big group text) and I truly don’t want to go. They are all significantly younger than I am, I’m quite introverted so staying in an Airbnb with 10 girls does not sound fun and the maid of honor who is planing is is a very high maintenance control freak so I’m already envisioning how this is going to go. I don’t think my friend would be upset if I didn’t go but I also don’t want to disappoint her. Should I just suck it up and go or should I regretfully decline?  You should go.

"Hi everybody. Sorry for the vague title, but I'm not really sure how to word this.

Basically, my partner always emphasizes very idealistic things that he'll do for me in the future/one day and uses that as leverage.

For example, my partner always says things like ""I'll buy you nice jewelry one day"" or ""I'll take you on a nice vacation one day.""  I'm not sure if he thinks that'll make me feel more excited/hopeful for the future, but it actually just makes me feel worse. In regard to the statements that he'll buy me something, I've never been much of a gift person, but because he makes those statements, I sometimes come to expect something and then become disappointed. Just recently he went on a trip, and he told me he would buy me some nice tea. Without him telling me prior, I would have never expected a gift, but of course, he didn't actually end up following through. I'm just so confused because why tell me something that I necessarily don't want to hear???? by telling me, I feel like he's just setting himself up for more failure and me for unnecessary disappointment?? this is a common pattern that has happened multiple times across a variety of themes.

While I feel like all his statements are super empty,  he often acts as if they're not. For example, we got into a bit of a scuffle the other day, and I said something that complained about how he never thinks of ""us"" and it's always just ""him."" In response, he retorted that he will move to my home country for me, something that i think is highly unlikely but he likes to daydream about i guess, so that's proof that he is thinking about ""us"" and willing to do things for ""us."" Additionally, even if we do move, that's like ten years away minimum, aka maybe too far away to be bringing up in arguments right now. 

I also feel that he's expecting that everything will just work out in the long run so he doesn't have any urgency to apply meaningful thought or real tangible effort to our relationship in the present, which makes me feel like he just expects that I'll stay with him no matter what because he has painted this idealistic future for us (which is not true). 

To be fair to him, I think he is only daydreaming about the future because he's going through a difficult time with his immediate family. but I'm wondering if 1. my feelings are valid, and that it makes sense to be frustrated at this sort of pattern, and if it does make sense, 2. how to go about communicating this to him in a way that's not an attack/harsh? and 3. how do I express that I would much rather appreciate some sort of effort in the present than to wait for a future that may never come? By saying he’ll do something for you “in the future” he’s gaining your positive reaction with ZERO cost or effort.  He has no intention of ever doing any of the things he says.  He couldn’t be assed to buy you tea? That was a no brainer, lowest effort possible option of something he actually could deliver.  I’m sure if you really sit down and think about it, you’ll find other equally effortless promises that he didn’t make happen.  He’s just stringing you along. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I (20M) have never had a girlfriend, am a virgin, and have only ever really been on a few dates in high school.

I want to try and put myself out there but really don’t know how. I’ve tried a dating app but half the time I don’t get responses. I feel as if I am decent looking and I am fit. I also have job stability being in the reserves and goals as I am a college student trying to become an officer. I don’t have any debt and I feel as if I am in a good financial state.

This might sound vague but what’s the best advice for trying to get started with dating as a young 20 year old? I started dating through social media platforms. Some time ago, I participated in a private test of a social software called LightUp: Make Real Friends . It matches you with people who share your interests based on your posts and helps you connect. By sharing my daily life on the platform, such as the scenery outside the door, travel places and other content, many interested netizens have interacted with me. We discussed the interesting things in our lives, and I also arranged to meet offline with a few friends I could chat with. My offline dates with these friends have gone very well because of my online chat base. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I just randomly found a bra I don’t recognise under mine and my partner of 10 years (30m) bed and am freaking out and don’t know how to proceed.
Part of the problem is there’s a number of possibilities besides the obvious it could be.

1. It might be an old bra that i had forgotten i had. It does seem to fit me but I have no memory of it at all and it’s not really my style.
2. We had someone house sit for us a while ago and I think his girlfriend stayed over for a bit, so it could be hers. 

My partner is away until tomorrow. How do I confront him and figure out what’s going on? 

 House sitter seems plausible. Investigate that first. [Practical Advice]"
"She’s also 28, I’ve known her since high school too but only started talking to her again two years ago, and only actually began seeing her in person this year.

As for why I’m a virgin, my life went to absolute fucking shit when I was 20.  I was in and out mental hospitals for years and I only just finished an associates degree last year.  I make 33 per hour which isn’t awful.  I’m a hard worker who doesn’t take corporate bullshitting though, so I got promoted fast.

This woman was my last loyal friend through these years.  Everyone else who wasn’t a family member kind of treated me like a damaged piece of equipment in the friend group (all my guy friends did that especially).  I got new friends eventually, thank God.  One more thing, if we had to judge her appearance, she is a straight up 10/10.  I’m not the only guy who thinks so, I’ve had other guys who asked to see her picture confirm it.  I’m worried I won’t have a shot if I’m a virgin but I really do like her and how loyal she’s been since literally 2012.

Help me decide here. I’ll be honest with you, she might just view you as a friend and not as a potential lover but I’ll say this. If you have the balls to man up and let her know that you find her attractive and that you want to be more than her friend then tell her before someone else tries to be her man. [Practical Advice]"
"Before suggesting breaking up, hear me out. I’ve been in this relationship for a couple of years and it is truly making me lose myself. I care too much, admittedly sometimes about very small and stupid things. We will fight about these small things constantly. I also care too much about seeing him whenever I can because we are long distance. I want to live for myself and not for this relationship as I feel like I’ve grown to be very codependent on him when he just prefers to be alone. I do have a few hobbies but I will still pick him over everything. I want to stop caring and stop chasing someone who is running away from me. So how do I start caring less about someone I love more than anything while having the complete intention of staying with them. Stop arguing over small things. if you are arguing & are long distance this is a problem. You can care for someone, doesn’t mean you have to be in a relationship. Start doing your things, you are the one choosing to not do them. [Commentator's opinion]"
"if you was asked by your boyfriend/ partner if you think they have a small penis would you say yes if you agreed or disagree not to hurt there feelings ?

"I am a 30F and I’ve been talking to a 25M for the past two months. We’ve been on 7 or 8 dates and they have all been going so well. Last night we went out to dinner and I slept at his place, like I have done many times before. We are extremely sexual and I have mentioned that I enjoy being choked during sex. He’s done it before and I’ve enjoyed it! This morning, we’re having a conversation in bed and are not in any position to start being intimate. The conversation was harmless but we started to debate a topic. After I said my side, he wrapped his hands around my throat for a few seconds. It didn’t necessarily hurt, but I was honestly shocked afterwards. I said he could choke me during sex and this was completely out of the blue….I brought it up later and said it really really concerned me. He apologized and said he would never hurt me and he didn’t mean it like that…should I give him another chance or run? You need to leave him. When it comes to choking in bed there need to be rules/boundaries for safety sake, and he obviously does not respect that. It's not something he should be doing out of irritation or anger, and if he is, it's a HUGE red flag. Do not trust this man with your life anymore. [Practical Advice]"
Me and my now ex have had a very complicated relationship. He has always been emotionally abusive in arguments and when we are not arguing he makes small digs at me that slowly eat away at my self confidence. When we argue he calls me things like a “failure” “weak” he will bring up all of my short comings and anything i’ve ever told him out of vulnerability. Recently we had a terrible fight and he said more horrible things to me and i got to angry i grabbed him by his face and I put my hands on him. He has also put his hands on me in some occasions which he says is not comparable to when i’ve find it because he did not leave me bruised and he felt remorse. I feel so terrible and now we are over. He is calling me an abuser and says we can never be together but i feel this is not fair. I do not feel justified in hitting him but i feel i was pushed to my limit. I hit him and had a panic attack and shortly admitted myself into the psych ward i have never felt such intense anger. I fear i have snapped and there is no going back.  You had a toxic relationship.  He was verbally abusive.  He was the initial abuser. You need to cut him out of your life 100%.  No decent man is ever going to verbally abuse you. [Practical Advice]
"For context, my boyfriend (M/30) isn't in any kind of secret relationship with her. She's dating his close friend, and lives in a different state than us. 

The reason I (F/27) have an issue with him following her to begin with is she was being mildly flirty with him one night via a discord chat (boyfriend plays video games with his close friend & she happened to be there).

I'm not okay with that, so I shut it down and told him it made me uncomfortable. So, I noticed he recently started following her on Instagram, but that isn't the part that bugged me. 

What bugged me is he went back and liked every single one of her posts all the way back to 2018. He didn't comment, but he liked them. Point is, why?

So, the first time I told him I wasn't comfortable with that, resulting in him blocking her. Eventually he unblocked her and followed her again (like wtf?). This time I unfollowed her for him, only for him to refollow her again months later.

We've been together 10 years and he has a history of purposefully doing things I don't like (yeah, I know). Is this one of those moments? Or is there something else going on? 

I've checked his messages and he's not physically speaking to her, so what gives?   i'll be honest... i'm a girl gamer and i befriended a few guys along the way. some single and some with girlfriends. 

i am hit on 99% of the time by the guys with girlfriends. and i even ended up talking to one of the guys who lived in another country who told me they broke up because she cheated on him, come to find out he lied and they were together the whole time and he had no remorse when i found out. 

please please just talk to him about it. i dont want to make assumptions but its very weird he's went and liked all her photos (that's a sign of flirting on instagram but being discrete about it. been there multiple times) and he's not listening to the boundaries you set and this is just giving me flashbacks of what i went through being on the other side.

it's easier to get away with emotional cheating than physical cheating. some men find it more fun to flirt with girls they will never see because they will never be there to confront him [Commentator's opinion]"
"I've been with this girl for about a month. She kissed another man and said it was a dare that she had to do. She then added that its not okay if i did the same, and that if I did she would be really mad at me and she would do something.

"
So me (F22) and my bf (M23) had a great sex life in the beginning. Usually once a day and he was enjoying it a lot, initiating it the majority of the time. I already had some problems with being rejected back then so I felt really overwhelmed when he sometimes wasn’t that much in the mood. However, that was controllable. Now 2 years into the relationship, he seems to just don‘t want me sexually anymore. His libido got really low half a year ago but we thought it was because of his semester abroad. Now he‘s been back for over 2 months but nothing’s changed. He seems to be less interested in me everyday. I also try everything, putting on sexy clothes, wearing makeup, doing my hair, doing sexy stuff to get him in the mood. But even when it works he seems to not enjoy it as much as he used to. He doesn’t touch me in „awe“ anymore and seems to not be in love with me and my body anymore. He denies that this is the case everytime I try to talk about it but still nothing’s changing. So now I‘m thinking if I‘m just overdramatizing it? And just wanted to ask if anybody else had similar situations and how you cope with the extreme feelings of rejection. Perhaps he’s cheating on you [Commentator's opinion]"
"I’m in a long distance relationship for 4 years with my boyfriend. For a year I’m trying to plan to visit him but things keep getting in the way. I’m renting an apartment and a few months ago during a storm something happened to the balconies that couldn’t wait so I’m in the middle of a renovation in my house right now as we speak and I can’t leave. However in the meantime my boyfriend keeps pushing me to come and is setting dates and barely takes no for an answer. We had many arguments about this and I’m always being accused of being a liar despite us video calling and him witnessing all the problems at my apartment. Occasionally he has even broken up with me a few times saying he doesn’t want to wait, but always comes back to me anyway. This adds stress to the situation, and in the meantime I started to have health issues… thinking it was just from the stress I went to the doctor and they did bloodwork and it came back not good. Worst case scenario, I possibly may have cancer and I’m waiting for the hospital to contact me. I’m very scared. When I tell him I feel unsupported and all he cares about is what he wants he says it’s not like he doesn’t care, he just thinks I don’t have it because god wouldn’t do that to us. All day every hour he makes comments saying “that’s why you should come here, I wish you’d come here, when are you buying your tickets, you should really be here, buy tickets” and it’s so draining. Like he doesn’t understand that I’m waiting for a appointment in the hospital and that’s priority right now. It makes me feel so alone, unsupported and not seen. I don’t want to keep defending myself and talk about it all the time and keep explaining myself. What can I do?  if he wants to see you that bad then he could take it upon himself to buy tickets to see you!!! you are obviously having a lot of difficulties at the moment and he could just think to himself 'maybe it would cheer her up if I visited her and helped her? ' 

I can say this as me (20m) and my partner (22m) are semi long distance, he is in a bad financial state and is waiting to start his new job, so for the last year I have driven every. single. weekend. to go see him because I understand his situation, and he does as well, saying that he will pay me back for everything (and genuinely means it) 

so comparing our situations, it sounds like your partner is either 1. lazy and doesn't wanna get off his arse to come see you. 

or 

2. doesn't care enough or see a long term possibility for your relationship, and therefore you are best getting out because it seems as if he doesn't wanna put in the effort for you, on top of you needing extra support right now he doesn't wanna give you the bare minimum.

"Hey guys, so I'm in need of your experiences. There's this one girl in my life... She makes me think about her all the time, getting lost in her eyes or just fall in love with her laugh on a regular base. We have a good friendship together. But, atleast from my side, I feel and want more than just being in a friendship with her. There's this fear of what happens if I express my feelings to her - what if she says no? 

I can't think of how much the loss of this friendship will hurt me. Did some of you have the same problem? and how did you handle it?

 Also excuse my english, thanks:) Try and you may fail. Don’t try and you guaranteed your own failure. And given enough years, the thing will hurt you most is the regret of things you left undone and things left unsaid. Even you tried and something, made mistakes, whatever… you’ll look back being glad you have some silly war stories. Who knows, maybe many years from now, you tell a bedtime story to your daughter about the friendship you had with her mother, and the fear you had at this very moment about expressing your feelings… and maybe a story about getting rejected several times before she agrees and say yes… whatever it is, it will be beautiful bedtime stories.

"I recently ghosted a guy online because he didn’t look how I imagined him to be, and I feel worried saying this. What do yall think? Ghosting is a shitty thing to do. If you're going to date, act like an adult and communicate.

"I am sorry ahead for some mistakes, English is not my first language.

I (21F) have been dating my boyfriend (21M) for 3 years. Over the past year, he has made 2 new female friends at his school. They would hang out after class and go for a lunch together (sometimes also with my BF's male friend as a group) and all four of them would also go out for drinks. Last week one of the girls wrote him and they spent half a day hanging out together and are planning a next meeting in July. (important info: she has a BF).

Despite this, I admit I am feeling jealous and it is putting a strain on our relationship (I am aware that this is my issue that I have to work on). I suggested to him that I would like to meet them, as I know it would ease my problem once I get to know them (also told him that). He was very hesitant, stating:

1. He doesn't know how to introduce me so it doesn't look forceful and awkward (his own words)
2. He doesn't view them as close friends/best friends yet, so he doesn't consider it necessary to introduce me.

Beside this issue, BF is very open and honest about everything and his friends know about me.

I would like to know your opinion on this situation, whether I am just overly jealous or I am in the right to feel unhappy about his stance on this matter. >Last week one of the girls wrote him and they spent half a day hanging out together 

So they went on a date? 

>They would hang out after class and go for a lunch together (sometimes **also with my BF's male friend** as a group) and all four of them would also go out for drinks.

>He doesn't know how to introduce me so it doesn't look forceful and awkward (his own words)

This is how you learn that your boyfriend doesn't also think of you as a friend. If he's hanging out with these two girls there is nothing forced or awkward about him inviting his girlfriend to join. just like he can invite his male friend to join. 

Unless it's a double date, then of course, you would be in the way. 

But my advice is don't try and change his mind because he's already decided and you would be wasting your breath. Instead respect how unhappy the situation is making you and decide what you want to do about it. 

Like for example you could say ""I'm really unhappy in this situation where you've made these friends that you can hang out with all day, that you are comfortable bringing your male friend along to meet but when I want to meet them it's forced and you can't figure out how to make that happen. It's just too complicated a situation. It's only complicated if there are romantic feelings between you and one of those girls. But I'm not going to try and change your mind. Because I don't want to date a guy who can't figure out how to include me in his life and friendships. Especially after 3 years together. There are obviously things you are trying to explore so you should be free to do that so that I don't have to sit here and feel like my boyfriend is cheating on me."" 

And that is how you free yourself of this whole situation. Give him back his shit and get yours from him and then you heal and move on to someone who has respect for you and behaves in a more trustworthy manner. [Practical Advice]"
My fiance and I have been together for four years. When we first got together we had sex & did sexual activities all the time. We couldn’t keep our hands off of each other. Last October we got busy renovating our new home and working all the time that we weren’t as active. We moved in together in March of this year and I was so happy to get back to being a lot more active. Living alone you have all the time and freedom to do it WHENEVER WHEREVER. We never do tho. It’ll go 2-3 weeks without anything. No making out. No touching each other sexually. The only time we do is if he’s in the mood. I’m always in the mood. I crave it. I have tried everything. I buy lingerie. I walk around naked. I ask. I beg. I’ve talked about it to him countless times. Cried to him. I’m so lost on what to do? What is the problem? What else can I do? I’ve asked if there’s something else and he swears there’s not. I know where he is and he’s not one to go out. He likes to do everything with me. He’s not sneaky and im always able to check his phone if I ask but I have never ever felt the need to. This is so upsetting. I don’t want our relationship to be like this forever. I love sex and the closeness. No matter how much I say it upsets me he just says “sorry”. I need advice. Someone who can understand. Anything.  Get a new fiance. [Sarcasm]
"Yesterday I (26 M) had an amazing first date with a girl (25 F) and I cannot stop thinking about her and the date. We were super affectionate, said amazing things to each other, had tons of fun. I’m honestly wanting to see her again so so bad. 

I’m assuming we will see each other for a 2nd date, but today she hasn’t text me for 8 hours and I’m getting tons of anxiety. I don’t know what to do with myself and i’m just anxious / sad staring at my phone waiting for a text. 

When monday hits I honestly plan on scheduling an appointment for therapy, I know this is probably not normal and I am either just extremely lonely or maybe something deeper. I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else tends to feel like this or experiences this :(, thank you everyone  I think this is normal

"This occurred a few months ago, but I've been thinking about it a lot. One night, while having sex with my boyfriend, we were in the missionary position with my legs on his shoulders, which allowed for fairly deep penetration, though not deep enough to cause pain at the time. Immediately after, I began to feel a light pain on one side of my abdomen. The pain worsened when I got home, and I couldn't sleep because it was so intense. The next morning, the pain was still present, but it had become sharp. I was worried I might have appendicitis or something similar. The pain became so severe that I nearly went to the hospital, but fortunately, it subsided after taking a few painkillers. What do you think might have happened? I Googled it and found that I might have ruptured an ovarian cyst, but I'm not sure.

"So my fiancé (31M) and I (28F) are getting married abroad after nearly 4 years together. His psycho ex (34F) is known for harassing her ex’s, befriending their baby mumma’s and making false accusations to police. My fiancé has a child with her so sadly we have to deal with her tapped behaviours for many years.

The latest move she has made is to book to stay just minutes away from where we are having our destination wedding. She manipulates my stepson (8M) (the child she shares with my fiancé) and squeezes information out of him. The latest she has extracted from him is the exact place we are staying and where we are having our wedding abroad. Due to him coming with us she had to be informed of the dates we are taking him out of the country.

I hate the thought of going around the town and bumping into her, or my stepson requesting to spend time with her when we are away on our holiday for mine and his dad’s wedding. Even more so, I hate the fact she could turn up at the address we are staying at to try to put a dampener on what should be such a special occasion that we have waited so long for.

Honestly it makes me feel sick and really makes me think of what my future looks like if these are the lengths she will go to.

"This is going to be a silly post but yesterday I got my first haircut in ~15 years. I’m a 27 year old guy and I’ve always been known for having really long hair and my hairstyle was honestly perfect for me— but I wanted to try something new out and so I took the risk and cut my hair. 

… big mistake and I went from hot to very very average. I’m going to take some time to focus on myself and just let my hair grow back out, but this honestly might be a good thing for my dating life? Maybe? 

I feel like dating as an attractive person is people seeing you (and making wild assumptions) more than actually getting to know you and this is going to sound extremely shallow, but I always see average looking people in relationships. The hot people that I know are all single or struggling to really find the right person. I’m not sure if that’s because there’s more options and so it’s a lot more weeding involved in dating. 

Maybe being average allows you to have one extremely compatible option that you see eye-to-eye with instead of several people that meet you and think they can do better or that you’re too good. Plus you don’t get immediately sexualized. 

I’m not sure, I’m kinda just typing and trying not too sound too shallow or crazy. 

But do you guys think that average people have an easier time dating than conventionally attractive people? 
 Dating is three things. Physical attraction, shared goals, and actually getting along with each other. 

Yes, there's such a thing as being pursued by people who don't actually like you because they think you're very physically attractive and don't care about anything else and it can be a practical problem. [Commentator's opinion]"

"Am I bad person? I 24M have fancied this girl, 23 F, for a very long time. She has been with her boyfriend 29M for 5 years. We have a massive friendship group and I have never had a convo longer than 5 minutes and would never meet up together. she has been unhappy for the past 2 years and he doesn’t treat her right. He kicked her out of his house (lives with his family) on Friday because she refused to give him a blowjob as forgiveness for going to a party the weekend before. She is treated like shit by most of the household and She has no other home and is a vulnerable girl who’s lost and feels unloved. She rang me and asked if she could stay at mine and I said yes, I wasn’t intending on anything happening was just looking after her. We ended up sleeping together and I’m just really confused on what to do. They’ve broken up now, but I’m worried about what to do next as the group can be very bitchy and it’s already raised suspicions and is being gossiped about. I really like her and I know I could treat her better than him. Should I carry on seeing her? Or am I just a massive prick? Congratulations OP you are a scumbag.

But don't worry there are plenty of us out here and if you put in some effort you can become a reformed former scumbag.

"I've met truly interesting people throughout time. Some i have met recently and i struggle to keep conversations going.   
I answer as soon as i can, interest myself to their hobbies and activities yet... It never seems to be enough. I end up waiting hours to get a few replies and then, it's back to waiting. A short daily exchange, no more.   
Any reason's why that might be?  
 Texting sucks. Try meeting in real life instead.
Be interesting. But more importantly be interested in the other person. If you ask about another person they will reciprocate and ask about you too. Works for dating, making friends, business partners, colleagues, school [Practical Advice]"
"Long story short, bf and I have been together probably over a year and after about 6 or 7 months he started staying at my place 5 days a week, only returning to his twice a week. 

I’ve never asked for his help with any bills or anything like groceries or rent. It would be nice for him to OFFER but his offers never go through. My rent is quite high yet I still pay for most of our outings when I can, and he’ll constantly reference my salary in comparison to his and our “tax brackets”. He also bought a dog and leaves it with me 24/7 as his place is too small. I hate it. I’ve voiced it. 

Two weeks ago I bought an apartment. I told him he can’t come over every day as I need to feel like the place is mine. He followed that with a rude comment about how he can’t date someone who’s always sad about going to visit their grandma in a retirement village (me lately as she has been suffering with dementia). This past weekend, he told me to “shutup” as a joke apparently in the morning when I woke up, told me I’m too lazy to do extra work at the gym (which apparently he knows because we “live” together) and then told me I would’ve been bad at my old job again as a joke apparently. Then kept commenting about my credit rating and my salary. Not sure wtf is going on but I feel like I’m not even able to celebrate this huge achievement of mine or feel like I can be myself without another rude comment coming my way about something. 

Help?  To start, no more him staying at your place and his dog needs to go to his place.  He is not a teenager, he is a 28 year old man.  Dump him.  Stop paying for anything. Don’t try to make this relationship work.  He is a loser and jealous of you. [Practical Advice]"
"Me and my girlfriend have been dating for 3 years, as of two nights ago we are on a break because she claims she doesn’t know if she wants anything serious, and needs to figure out what she wants, I expect I will be broken up with in a little bit here. This was my first relationship, my first actual love, she has treated me extremely poorly throughout most of the relationship, so originally I was not too distraught about breaking up, until I learned about the “man’s first love theory”, where basically every man never stops loving the first person they fell in love with, and I have since read about so many men who 5, 10, 20 years after breaking up with their first love they still wish they could go back to them, I even saw someone say that they were 40 with a wife and kids and still wish they were with their gf when they were 17. I am so scared this is going to happen to me, I do not want to compare her to every person that comes after her but I’m afraid I will, I’m afraid that losing her will ruin my life. Does anyone have any experience with this? Is this something I should be worried about? Or does everyone think this after their first break up?

TL;DR Breaking up with my first gf of 3 years who treated me poorly, Im afraid of the theory that every man keeps loving their first love their entire life. Is this true? Should I be scared? 
The real issue you should be focusing on, is why you want to date someone that treats you poorly? Why is there no requirements for your love?

Why aren’t you trying to end this much sooner when you had poor treatment.

"I know it hasn't been that long, but the first 5 months of the relationship were amazing. We clicked really well off the start, we took our time and didn't rush things, and things were overall really good. Around 5 months in is when things between us got really serious, and is when I noticed she was acting strange. 

She does this thing where she'll text me ""good morning"", ""hey how are you"", etc., just casual things to check in and start a conversation. I will reply reasonably quick, however, she will leave me on delivered for like 3-4 days. Then she'll finally respond, we'll have a small conversation where she would seem very interested, and finally one of us would set up a date for the weekend. 

After 4 weeks of this she left me on delivered for like a week, even after I double texted her (this was the only time I did it). I finally texted her a third time asking her if everything was alright, because things have felt very off. She said she didn't know, but also felt she wasn't ready for a relationship. We had a quick phone call with no hard feelings and have gone on our way.

Basically my question is why would she text me first, then just leave me on delivered for days at a time? I know none of you can read her mind, or know the exact situation, but this has been confusing the hell out of me. If anyone has a similar situation, or a hunch at what the answer could be, please let me know. thanks

TLDR; After 5 months of a relationship, this girl will text first then leave me on delivered for days at a time. It has been confusing me and I want to know why she did that. She doesn’t know. How would Reddit know?

Maybe he wasn’t as into you as she wanted? She was doing what she thought was required and second guessing it or attention elsewhere. [Commentator's opinion]"
"TLDR: I slept with the sister of my close friend's wife before I've met my girlfriend and she can't accept it. It looks like we are gonna break up due to this problem. Do you know what would help in this situation?  
  
As you might have guessed from the title, I slept with the sister of a close friend's wife. This close friend and I consider each other cousins, but it's important to note that we are NOT blood relatives.

The girl I slept with is rather promiscuous, not very smart, and definitely not a catch. When this happened, I didn't have much confidence and didn't consider myself much of a ladies' man.

I slept with her years before I met my girlfriend, but this really bothers her. We are together for 2 years, but now it looks like it might be over. She doesn't have much confidence and feels like I don't care about the type of girl I'm with. She doesn't believe that I wouldn't just sleep with anyone who comes my way anymore.

Of course, this isn't true, and I only desire my girlfriend. However, she can't seem to believe it. Whenever we have sex, she always thinks about what I did in the past, and it completely kills her mood. But I think this only happens after she orgasms because she always does. I suppose she wouldn't be able to if she were dwelling on it.

It's been an issue for over a year now, and unfortunately, it seems like we've said our final goodbyes. But I still have hope. I love her very much and am deeply attached to her. Today she told me she needs an assertive man. Well, because of our problem, I haven't been able to provide that for her lately.

I feel that if she had more confidence, this wouldn't be a problem, but of course, I can't be sure. Maybe that's not the case. What would you do in my situation? Do you have any ideas on how to overcome this problem? Do you think this can be fixed somehow?  Ok how did she rind this out? Usually talking about past relationships and/or sexual partners is a no no in current relationships. Besides I don't see what the big deal is as most people will have a sexual past. That seems odd.

"22M

Just looking for advice on how to better accept my loneliness and the fact that I'm never going to be wanted. After years of trying and trying I've finally given up on dating and accepted that I'm incapable of being loved and nobody will ever want me. I asked out many girls, tried dating apps, went out on dates. All of it went nowhere for the last 5 years. 5 years of failure and rejection. I'm done. I get it. I'm worthless. I'm not allowed to be happy. I accept that. 
 
I Did so many things to try and improve myself and my desirability. I went to college and got a degree and got a decent job making good money for my age, got my own place, lost a lot of weight, got tattoos, bought a nicer, newer car since I was earning better money, put myself out there by hanging out with friends a lot, etc. Despite all this, I was still rejected all the time and have never had a gf. I'm done trying so hard for something I'll never have. I'm better off dead but I can't die for my familys sake. 

How do I better cope and accept this fate of mine? I've been looking into forcing myself to be apathetic and non caring anymore. Currently I just smoke weed and play video games to cope with things but it isn't working so great anymore. Any advice on this appreciated.
 Hell brother, I’m 29m and still struggling with accepting this fate. What I do is spend time with friends, focus on work as much as possible, and just try to preoccupy my mind and time to keep it from coming up. [Practical Advice]"

however i find myself having severe anxiety around him, i have social anxiety disorder, so maybe that’s it. but i hear a lot of people say that your body will tell you when someone ISN’T right for you. you’ll get stomach pain, break out, not get sleep, and your appetite will decrease.

i am hardly eating now, i get diarrhea a lot just from sheer anxiety, i’m breaking out, i can hardly sleep, and i have terrible stomach pain. he’s truly so wonderful and caring, extremely respectful and the whole nine yards, but with the way i feel i’m concerned it’s my body telling me he’s not right for me.

consequently when you’re with the right person you’ll be getting sleep, you’ll glow, your color will come back, etc.

"My gf and I have been seeing each other for about 8 months now, and I she told me from the beginning that she is horrible at decision making. 

Over our time together, there’s been a few occasions where it was easy for her to decide on something, but most often she cannot make a decision for the life of her. I’m not only talking about big life things, but all the way down to little things like what food to order and what to watch on tv. It stresses her out so much she begins to almost panic and have a some anxiety over it. 

It’s not all difficult for me to decide on things so it’s hard for me to relate, but it’s just wildly exhausting at times.

"The meme is the one where people say, when Asian women date outside their race it’s only white guys. 

Just want to make it clear that I don’t believe in making generalizations about people. I don’t use the meme and it’s just something I keep running into online. Also I hope that this doesn’t turn into a type vs fetish conversation lol. For simplicity let’s just say external factors are the reason why I have a type. 

For context I’m a hispanic male in mid 20s. Like I know that it’s extremely common and there is nothing wrong with it. But I also realize that an extreme generalization about people does not apply to everyone. Since I know of people that break the stereotype. I’ve also been involved in situations that go against this stereotype.

I feel in my case there have been a couple instances where things don’t work out for an unexplainable reason. Then the brain looks for random things that could explain why things did not work out.

"i (25f) have been dating a guy (25m) for 7 months consistently. 2 nights ago (saturday) we had plans to see each other but he got off work later than anticipated so we decided to wait until the following day. he told me he’d call me before bed. he never called me and i called him a few times and he never replied which was weird. he texted me yesterday morning (sunday) saying that he had just fallen asleep etc. later in the afternoon yesterday (sunday), we were out and i noticed a small spot on his neck that looked like a hickey. he denied it being a hickey but i kept pushing him and he eventually told me that he had slept with someone else, the night before (saturday). my entire world shattered in that moment and i was inconsolable. 

we have spent nearly every single day together for the last 7 months. his justification was that he’d rather “get it out of his system now” because he “wants to be with me long term”. i don’t even know what to say. i am crushed. i have been crying to the point where i can’t breathe for the last 12 hours. he keeps telling me how he “likes me so much and wants a serious future with me hence why he did this now before things continue to progress”, but that’s BS to me. we have already invested 7 months into one another. i can’t even fathom him inviting another girl over and having sex with her while i laid in bed calling him just bc i wanted to hear his voice before i fell asleep. i am crushed. genuinely, i have never felt so much emotional pain in my life.

i keep picturing him inside her and i can’t eat, i can’t sleep, i can’t focus, i cannot stop crying. he shattered my heart. my question is, how do i move forward? how do i make sense of his “justification” for sleeping with someone 7 months into our relationship? he knows i have a history of being cheated on twice prior and this just feels like the biggest betrayal of them all. the mental imagine of him making love to another woman in the bed he’s held me in for 7 months has me in sheer agony. i feel beyond broken. I won’t wish being cheated on, on my worst enemy. Its absolute bs that he wanted to get it out of his system. The relationship is new. Sex between you two should be the most desirable. 

He knows your history of being cheated on. Unfortunately, you met a douche that took what you shared with him as a blue print. Some guys see what you been through as something you will tolerate. 

You have to draw the line and end it. Do not allow it. Cheating has no justification and very rarely do relationships make it after infidelity. [Emotional Support]"
"I'm (26M) very new to dating. I never dated or have ever been in a relationship just due to me being very introverted and extremely shy growing up, but I've recently starting growing out of that shell more and I've made a few dating app profiles to get started. I'm just wondering if it's something I should be straight forward about to possible matches, and if it might be something that might be a red flag or just a turn off in general.  No, you shouldn't do that.

It would be comparable to you approaching a woman, and immediately (right when you first ever talk to her) apologize e.g. for being shy, or for not being eloquent, or for being quite nervous, or for daring to be in her presence.

All of that comes out of a bad mindset, that apologetic, fear-fueled, pleasing-mode mindset. Any woman with half a brain, and also any man with half a brain, will understand quite well, that in these times many, many men are not only vastly less experienced than most women (of the same age but also more mature and older men), but often have zero experience. 

And, yes, women, by and large, prefer men with experienced because women don't like to take the lead in seduction. Most of them don't want to that, don't like to do that, fear doing that even more than you and also find it considerably more exciting if and when the man does that.

But, experience isn't as important as the will to take action. Balls are considerably more potent in such contexts as having experience. Experience alone will not be enough for any random mean that already fucked 5 girls to approach this one girl he likes or to make a move on the dates. He might have a bit easier time to find his balls because he knows he already had balls in the past most likely. 

But, it is the will to take action that is the most decisive varible. Explaining what you believe you're lacking in to 'apologize' (for what, eh?) or to generate empathy on the side of the woman is all weak. You don't wanna do that.

All this BS you might have heard about men opening up,being vulnearable, showing their feelings and emotions is all shit. 

Women like it when a man can be strong, has balls, can take initiative. And, lucky for you, possibly 75 % of women do not require you to be ultra smooth, ultra confident, ultra experienced. But, what 99,9 % of woman want, is that a guy isn't a complete coward with zero balls. 

Doesn't matter that you have zero experience. Ask her if you can kiss her in a good moment after maybe 1 or 2 dates. 

Never later. Asking is not that good, but still vastly better than doing nothing, and it can work with quite a few women. Once you kissed a few girls or one girl for a longer time, a few dates and you then meet alone, it's gonna lead to sex. Once you experience that a few times, you already have experience.

I don't know if it's him specifically or sex in general. I went to the doctor about it. I've only had sex with one other person and the feeling was similar.  My doctor suggested porn together and masturbation but it didn't really work. Any suggestions or thoughts? What doctor suggests porn as a solution lol

"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years and we have lived together for 7 months. We have had a LOT of issues in our relationship, mostly done by him and his addictions. I’ve decided to stay and help him get through his issues, even if that means hurting myself in the process. 

There has been porn addiction and online sexting that has happened throughout our entire relationship up until February when I found out. Because of this, I am extremely cautious and a little self conscious about myself and the way I look. 

Yesterday, he showed me a text from his friend. It was a gif. When I looked at the entire screen, his friend sent him a video of women in lingerie dancing with light sabers (my boyfriend is a big Star Wars fan). My boyfriend’s response was “we need to go to the strip club lol”. 

We went to sleep after. Today he asked me what was wrong; and I said “I want to tell you, but you’re going to be annoyed.” And he said “just tell me”. So I told him seeing that text made me uncomfortable and I didn’t like that his friend felt okay with sending him a video of women in lingerie dancing. And I didn’t like his response, as I’m not okay with him going to a strip club or entertaining other women.

He immediately got defensive and started cussing saying “I’m never going to the fucking strip club, if anyone texts me like that I will respond with ‘fuck you my girlfriend doesn’t like these texts. Loose my number you piece of shit’ I know you hate this friend and you told me you never want to hang out with him again. I only talk to him at work and he sometimes texts me weird fucking shit”. I started holding my hands up because he was borderline yelling and I stood up and he said “you know what. You stay in here I’ll fucking go downstairs”. 

I almost feel bad for being upset because he didn’t intend for me to see that part of his texts (I wasn’t going through his phone, he was holding his phone, I just read the entire screen). I know that’s a “guy” thing to do but he’s 40 and has hurt me and my ego countless times by entertaining other women. 

Mind you, I was calm. I know I should have said something yesterday when it happened, but I also attended my grandpas funeral yesterday so my emotions were all over the place. I knew he would get annoyed which is why I don’t like to tell him what’s wrong with me, and he proved me right. I don’t really know what to do or how to go from here. I ended up taking a bubble bath and the bathroom door is closed. What should be my next move?  Why would you stay with someone who treats you like this?

"Hi Reddit,

I'm in a really tough spot right now and could use some advice. My boyfriend (25M) and I (25F) have been together for over three years. We both have a strict no-clubbing policy to avoid anything that might jeopardize our relationship. He recently moved to Italy, and I'm in Asia. During the early stages of our relationship, I went to a few parties because my friends forced me. He made a huge fuss about it and even threatened me, despite knowing I’m not a party person.

Fast forward to now, he shared his iCloud ID with me so I could help him fix his LinkedIn and make professional accounts on Behance. While doing this, I saw videos of him at a club, zooming in on girls, and also noticed verification codes for Tinder and Hinge on his email. When I confronted him, he got furious, accused me of being suspicious for no reason, and claimed it was an old video his friend shared with him.

I know it wasn't an old video because the event took place last night, as confirmed by his Google Maps location. He also mentioned that boys do this kind of stuff and share it with their friends, but the timestamps on the videos were just 15 minutes apart. This is making me very suspicious.

Additionally, he's been going to pubs where girls are apparently asking him for hookups, and he's receiving emails from OnlyFans. I'm devastated, and my mind keeps replaying that video. My hands are shaking, and I'm having panic attacks. I don’t know how to process this or what to do next.

Any advice on how to move forward and confront him would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you. He's actively cheating on you. Dating sites? I mean, if it hasn't gotten physical YET then it's only because he hasn't had to chance to yet. And he's obviously not following the ""no clubbing"" boundary.

There's no point in confronting him. He's obviously lying to you, and will just continue to do so. 

Just break up. ...And get tested. [Practical Advice]"

Just think I'm getting used or use as a back up guy because I feel like if she only wants to hang out during the night or during the day she probably embarrass me because she might be in a relationship with someone because I don't think I'm bad looking I'm sick too. I go to the gym. I work out I play for.
I'm pretty funny most people said and I'm pretty cool to hang out. What are you guys think? I'm being used or not You should communicate with her then! It’s not cool at all that she’s doing this to you time and time again. If she’s truly interested in you then she would make the time when it’s convenient for both of you. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I’ve (27f) been seeing this guy (28m) since October 2023. We’ve been dating for a while now, but whenever I bring up the idea of being boyfriend and girlfriend, he seems really hesitant. I was OK with it at first because I thought he would come around but now it’s very apparent that he probably will never. I want to tell him in person that I don’t want to see him anymore, but he is a New York for the next couple of days. He invited me to come up, which is really tempting but because he seems hesitant to commitment I kind of don’t want to spend any more time together. Should I wait for him to return or should I FaceTime or text him that I don’t want to see him anymore before he gets back? Are you exclusive? If yes, do you really need to put on a label as bf/gf? [Commentator's opinion]"
"My (30f) BF (30m) of 10 years wants to have sex with someone else. For context, we have bother never dated anyone else and are each other's firsts. This year I have decided to take the plunge and move in with him as I felt like I was finally ready to settle down and this was a very big step for me. My boyfriend has recently told me that he has been having thoughts about having sex with someone else / other people. He said he's been on his mind for a while now and won't go away and he had finally decided to tell me but initially didn't because he was scared of ruining a good thing. He said he loves me and wants to be with me and this it is purely a physical fascination and it'll be once. He also encourages me to do the same but I do not have that desire. This topic briefly came up a few years back but I didn't want to go through with it and we dropped the matter.  When he told me he still wants to explore having sex with someone else I was initially cautious but open to it because I thought I/we were mature enough to do this and that it would be one time but honestly its been an emotional rollercoaster and I am not sure if I can last the relationship. He is currently away on a big trip and we had discussed and decided that this trip is where he will do his 'exploring'. I thought if it were contained in a place far away I would be able to cope better but it's been really hard.  Sometimes I am so upset / angry that I am compromising my values and sometimes I feel okay. I feel like I've finally decided to move in and settle down with him and he has decided he wants to explore which in my mind does not feel like he is committed to me and this relationship. A lot of thoughts in my brain include what if this isn't a one-time thing, what if I resent him forever? He has been my first and only boyfriend and it is terrifying to think of starting all over again when I have finally made the decision to settle down with him. 



This has been something hard to discuss with close friends and I feel like no one has been through anything similar. I'm so conflicted and could really use some advice / other perspectives     If it bothers you so much, that is totally fine, but come on, you shouldnt have ""allowed"" him to do some exploring, if it mentally tears you apart.

How can he guarantee you that its a one time thing? He cant. 

This relationship is over. [Commentator's opinion]"
"You can scroll through my previous post about the history of my father but a quick rundown. Since I was young he used to show me this woman and do a shh motion to indicate I shouldn’t tell my mom. They ended up getting a divorce and towards the end of my parents marriage he wasn’t even trying to hide it anymore. She was the other woman. He brought her over to our country and started a life with her. She’s defo younger but not sure by how much. Anyways. My brother M22 was raised quite oblivious to why our parents marriage ended. Hes always been protected in that sense. In life in general tbh.

Meanwhile from young I got exposed early to porn, my father’s affair and PTSD from loud noises of my parents arguing. Life was never stable for me since.

Anyways fast forward to today. The dust has settled a little bit since all that stuff went down. Till I went to visit my father. I saw her stomach swollen up and he told me he had news. My heart just sank and it felt like I had been kicked in the stomach. He saw my blank look and started frowning and provoked me to answer. I told him about my concerns that he’s getting old, and needs to be more careful but more about the fact that I feel like this child is his way of getting revenge on “his old life” whenever he sees us I know he’s reminded of his failed marriage, and this is his way out. I told him that we barely have a functional relationship as it is and now he wants to bring a new kid into the world, it’s a recipe for neglect. 

Even as well when it comes to things like money and child support cos I have a younger sister too, he’s very inconsistent with that and it’s always a problem for him, now a whole child??? We’re never gonna see a penny. As if it already wasn’t hard enough. I don’t see him very often cos life gets in the way and college. But idk maybe I’m being spiteful. The other woman said to me “what do you want me to do remove it?”

I’m currently sat in my brothers car busting into tears and not sure what to do, how can I make my father see it from my point of view? Unfortunately, you can’t control other people. There’s no way to make him see things from your perspective. I know that sucks. I had a freakishly similar experience to yours. Over the years reading many many self help books and several therapists later, I’ve come to understand that I just have to accept it. Easier said than done, but not impossible. Some people are just shitty, and some of those shitty people just happen to be our family members. Sending hugs ♥️ [Emotional Support]"
"My girlfriend and I are in a huge fight right now.
We've been together for two years and love each other but keep fighting over little things. She was mostly saying I should change how I did some stuff. I'll be honest: I really should work on many things and have been trying to. It's just that I seem to always fall back into the habit of doing those things again. She tells me about them by not saying anything many of the first times I do it or getting mad and just saying it's okay when I ask about it. Then we talk about it, and it blows up because she's been holding it in for so long, and it's not making her feel good. I keep telling her that it would work so much better if she told me upfront when I did those things to knock it off, but she's telling me she does, and she doesn't understand what l'm saying. She doesn't bring them up the next day or way later after I've done whatever l've done. She doesn't mention many specifics about what I did (sometimes she does). When she tells me about it after the fact, I try to look out for it, but I don't realize it's happening until it's too late and we have the conversation again. One time, she glared at me when I talked over her. I had a habit that annoyed her, and every time she glared at me, I recognized the problem and almost completely stopped. Back to the argument, she says she does tell me right after, but she doesn't. She waits until we are together anymore at home and texts me about it. She says she's ""not confrontational,"" but I don't think letting a partner know what they're doing is wrong, especially when I asked for it as confrontation. I understand it's frustrating when you keep bringing something up and nothing changes but i'm trying to tell her a solution and she's telling me she doesn't understand. How do I tell her that communication should be constant when she doesn’t believe? Honestly it sounds like ur the issue. She wouldn't have to communicate so much if just stopped doing the things again [Commentator's opinion]"
"My fiancé and I are currently on vacation together with our 10 month old and I need some clarification. 

We were getting back in the car after a walk and I asked for my water, he gave me a water bottle and I took a swing out of it. He then realized that was his, but before giving me mine to me he said he needed to make it half and half so he took a swing out of my water before giving it to me. I was in shock. But this behavior is normal coming from him. 

Is this normal? 
He said he grew up in a way that his parents always did half and half with his sister. 
He wants half and half with everything, and I just think that doesn’t work in a relationship. 

Any advice? Do I need to be more open minded to how he grew up or will this never work and I need to ask him to change his perspective of things? 

 There's a difference between sharing relationship responsibilities and being petty and childish. 

If a man sees his partner is thirsty and instead of thinking, ""Let me get her water, so she feels better,"" and instead thinks, ""I can't share my water with her. It would be unfair to allow her to have more to drink than I have,"" that is an emotionally immature, selfish, cruel human being who is incapable of basic human decency and empathy.

Be very cognizant of the lessons this man is going to teach your child. 

I would not pursue marriage until there was serious, intense couples counseling. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I met someone on a dating app 2 months ago and since then, we've been on 3 dates. We haven't seen each other for a month now and talking to him over the phone is shit. He's a dry texter, and I mean DRY. He replies once a day. He said he prefers talking in person, which I did notice from those 3 dates. I should mention that we met on an adult dating app, which basically are just for hookups, fwb's, etc. But, on those 3 dates, nothing really happened. It was just a wholesome and fun hangout/date for me but I enjoyed them. We haven't talked since last week when I tried to make plans (for our next day out) and he said he wanted to rest instead. Personally, I understand that, but I can't help but overthink this as him not wanting to go out with me anymore?

I recently got on another dating app (a real dating app this time) and I came across his profile. I know he has a profile on that app as he's told me before so i wasnt surprised. I was just wondering if it would be okay to start another (dreaded) conversation with him and tell him that I came across his profile on that app? Or would that be too creepy? or desperate? or what? it doesn’t really matter what you say to him tbh. you’re not exclusive and you’re both doing your thing as you said you’re on an app for fwb, etc. however if you’re not having sex then there’s really not much to talk about imo unless feelings change for either of you. if you’re not getting what you want, ask for it or move on [Commentator's opinion]"
"Dating for 1.5 years and intimacy has been very minimal because “antidepressants took his sex drive”. We were semi open because we always agreed sending nudes was not an issue. As for physical encounters we could talk about it.
He knows I am not asexual but that I am waiting for him and his times with his own self journey.
We are on a trip for Pride parade. Something he always wanted to attend to but never could, last week he was sad we couldn’t come because I am in a difficult moment money-wise. He told me how sad he was and I immediately spent money I don’t have on the trip. 
Went clubbing, got drunk, came back and I checked his phone while he slept and found out texts from last week.
The day before the infidelity happened he had told me he could not invite me to his house because his room was messy.
Then in the texts I found he offers his house for the hookup, went to pick the guy up at 3am and returned him at 6 and even paid him. 
At 5am he texted me he was watching a movie. I am repulsed at the thought he was watching it with the guy on his bed.
I’ve been distant all day. We go back to our city tomorrow and I don’t know if I should talk about it now and end the trip in a weird way, or wait until we are home. please speak up, there’s no excuse for cheating [Practical Advice]"
"Hi! So I’m 19 years old and I’ve been on dating apps for about 9 months now. I’ve been on about 30 first dates with 30 different guys. About 10 of them have turned into longer flings  (4-7ish dates). But every situation has ended after about 3 weeks. I’ve never had something last longer than a month. (I’m not sleeping with any of these guys) but It’s still very draining on my mental health to constantly go through the spiral of getting my hopes up on a new guy just for it to end like the rest of them. I can’t help but think something is wrong with me and it’s an emotional spiral that I don’t know how much more of it I can take. I know the easy answer is to get off the apps but I want to be in a relationship, I just don’t know how much more of the ups and downs of dating I’m able to take. And any new guy I start talking to, I just think to myself that he’s gonna end up like all of the rest of them. Is this a normal experience? And how can I protect my mental health going through this process? STOP DATING APP. It meant to get you addicted and never truly connect in the first place, because it's fleeting by nature.

"I’m starting to search for a more longterm thing, would i be fooling myself if I get intimate early on like I have when looking for casual fwb type relationships? Like first through 3rd date is that going to either only attract people looking for casual stuff or like put me in a box where I won’t be seen as a good candidate for a girlfriend? But on the other hand, if someone is looking for something more serious and I don’t sleep with them early on then will they think we are not compatible? Some people think you gotta get the emotional stuff started or a good friendship basis. How true has that been for y’all? Hasn't been true for me at all. I hooked up with my partner as soon as we saw each other again after some years. We started our relationship then and there. When it clicks well it's almost natural. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I have been with my bf for about 3 years,we met on a dating app when we were freshly 18. Throughout the years he has had a lot of home life issues which caused him to be jobless and homeless for a bit. He is a good man but just seems to have been dealt with the worst cards in life. Here’s my issue, he moved in suddenly with me and my folks about a year ago. We agreed to split the bills and rent as long as he worked. He had a job for about 6-7 months then quit and went on a trip with his friends. I embarrassingly lent him money for the trip since he didn’t have enough to cover his half. He didn’t get a job till about 4-5ish months later. Which left me paying for just about everything, Including his half of rent. He unfortunately didn’t have any money saved either, even after being payed weekly. He used daily pay constantly even after I expressed my concerns with his financial decisions. I love him very much but I think its finally time to break it off. The thing is that I worry about where he will go after if I do break up with him. He has no nearby family(family moved out of state and are estranged) and I worry about his mental health. Financial problems have been a constant strain in the relationship, I work a decent job and make enough for us to scrape by but it has been starting to eat away at my savings. Even at the beginning of our relationship ive been the one paying, even when I only worked for minimum wage. I understand how expensive moving out can be and I worry that I’ll just be putting him out on the streets. I try my best to understand how he must be feeling about our current circumstances but I feel as if it’s costing me my mental health and well being. How do I approach this with him?

"Me (male 21) and my partner (female 21) has been together for one and a half years. It is my first relationship and we spend all our time together since we are both in the same uni. The two of us would spend so much time together that both of our social circles diminished. One the extreme end, for me in particular, I have been trying to avoid socialising or even keeping in touch with my close friends for months. Before my relationship with my partner, I'm the sort of introverted person who would enjoy their time alone, but would still crave for social interaction periodically depending on my mood, as I enjoy making new friends, getting to know them and forming meaningful bond with them. But for the past 3 months or more, I haven't had the slightest motivation to talk to anyone but my partner. I even started ghosting my closest friend from all the way back in high school, it almost feels like a chore to talk to anyone but my romantic partner.   
  
I know this sounds very unhealthy, and it really is. Now I'm barely in touch with any of my friends. To them, it probably felt like i fell off the surface of the earth lol. My social life has been damaged to a point where I basically don't have anyone to hang out with and worst of all, I DO NOT WANT to talk to them despite knowing how problematic is it to not have a social like beyond your partner. But i genuinely do not want to have fun in the absence of my partner because it makes me feel guilty whenever i do have fun without them. For example, if i am part of very enjoyable conversation, I would constantly wish that my partner is here and it would sometimes make me feel extra guilty (it almost feels wrong) whenever I sense myself starting to enjoy a conversation or someone's company. In a fucked up way, it almost feels like I'm cheating on my partner by having fun without them. Therefore I sometimes find me unconsciously disallowing myself to have a social life outside my relationship. 

Why am i feeling this way? has anyone else felt guilty for making new friends/having fun when your romantic partner is not around? How can I stop feeling this way as it is obviously very unhealthy? 

Please help, need advice! I think the new relationship energy, especially since it’s your first one, is skewing things for you away from healthy and into really codependent.

It’s healthy to have your own friends, hobbies, and interests in addition to those you share with your partner. Abandoning all other relationships and making your partner your sole person is not healthy. It’s okay to wish to share things with a partner but this is over the top.

What you’re experiencing isn’t that uncommon for young people but it usually blows up. Either your partner feels smothered or you end things and have no one on your team left as they’ve moved on without you.

You might want to talk to a therapist. [Commentator's opinion]"
"We’ve been official for about 3.5 months but dated and knew each other before that, we both love each other and it was such a perfect relationship, and even though we argued very rarely about things it was always calm and kind and led to a deeper understanding of each other. A few days ago we had a big fight based on a lack of understanding of each other, and it led to us explaining to one another why we feel the way we feel and made us so much closer. But the fight scared me and left me feeling like I was taking the blame for all of it when in reality the whole situation was bad and truly blameless. Because I’m stupid and immature I started to try and blame her for the fight because I couldn’t handle the fault for it even though she never even blamed me, I just felt like she did. This ended up hurting her and didn’t even make me feel better, it just made me realize that I have a lot of problems that I need to fix. Because I didn’t feel better and I was stressed about everything that I needed to fix I was super irritable and felt like I was getting mad at her, and I didn’t know why and she felt it and it obviously hurt her, and I tried so hard to explain it to her but I just couldn’t because I didn’t understand it at the time. Eventually after a long time of thinking and writing down everything that I feel I managed to understand why I felt the way that I did, and I only felt irritated by her because I was so overwhelmed and stressed out by so many things that were centered around her, but weren’t any fault of her own. So while I was hurting her because I couldn’t put my feelings aside, she was comforting me and talking me through everything and trying to understand me and fix me and make everything work. And I kept telling her how sorry I was for hurting her and how horrible I felt for not being able to put my feelings aside and just show my love for her, but for some reason she forgave me and comforted me and still loved me and so now I feel like the biggest pos right now and I have no idea what I can do. She loves me so much and she’s so kind and caring and good and she’s an angel and I hurt her and I know she forgives me but I put a lot of strain on her and on our relationship and I just have no idea how to fix this. What that initial incident was about, you left that out. I'll respect it but its useful information.

Anyways... You're together for 3.5 months romantically, that's brand new. Hard to say if you two even have a sense of ""normal"" because it has not been established yet.

Experience together is what creates ""normal""... And this is the first moment you had in your relationship, it won't be the last.

Shit like this is what actually takes relationships to deeper levels. Actual experience together.

The goal is to do better next time. Really smoothing the relationship out so there is only positive energy. Mistakes are bound to happen and its just a part of figuring each-other out.

A great thing here is your self reflection.

Something negative happened. You two talked about it. Sorted it out. Thought about how you can do better next time. Reflecting on yourself. That's a good recipe.

Some just say sorry and its out of their mind. Repeating the same thing next encounter. Stuck in the same loop. 

Your path results in conflicts bringing the couple closer together. You learn from each-other, make up, take some homework for the road, desiring to better the realtionship next time around. Conflict resolution that introduces deeper understanding and being in tune with things; actually developing it.

For a spot like yours, I would try to wrap things up. Don't drag things out longer than it needs to be.

Say you're sorry again... And then take her out and enjoy each-others company. Go have some fun together and get back into a positive groove.

I am sure the next time you will be more self-aware in the moment and go:

>Okay, last time I did this and I failed miserably. I want to do better this moment and keep this at a more tame moment.

Wrap this situation up. Treat her our to your company and have a good time together, learn to put it to rest. It was already discussed and settled, now get back into having fun. [Commentator's opinion]"
"Got broken up with after a month and a half of a relationship. It was great and we were having a great time getting to know each other. Then all of a sudden,  He was panicking about the future and was freaking out about the prospect of getting married. I assured him that I wasn’t trying to marry him  or move in with him and that I liked him but that was not on my radar at the moment. He seemed assured at that comment initially but still freaked out about it and ended things.  I never mentioned the future once, but he made me feel like I was trying to put a ring on it. I can’t think of what I could have done for him to act like this. Why would a guy freak out about marriage so early into a relationship?   Sounds like maybe he had a lot of pressure from his family. Maybe he is the only one left who hasn’t gotten married yet so he felt pressure from someone [Commentator's opinion]"
"not a lie title sounds as bad as it is 😂 context she came home early i had tank top on and a pair of knickers 🤦‍♂️ realistically is it over between us ? i’m 22 and she’s 25 been together 2 and a half years  Is she mad because you ruined her knickers or about you wearing women’s clothes at all? If this is a kink for you then you should probably try to explain what about it turns you on. Otherwise, she might be imagining all sorts of incorrect things about why you were wearing her underwear.

If you stretched out her knickers then you should offer to replace them. [Commentator's opinion]"
"So I just went on a date with this girl who was really nice and friendly, but I didn’t really feel a romantic interest in them kind of a friendship feeling? Not sure if it’s because of the date location being a theme park or if it’s how I feel. 

She’s transferring colleges to another state later this year so I also almost don’t see the point in trying to get to know her if she’s leaving? Am I wrong for thinking that? 

Idk what to do, she’s really nice and I don’t want to hurt her feelings, but I also am not sure if going out again is a good idea? Just be honest with her and say that you didn’t really feel the connection and/or that you made up your mind that you don’t want to start anything with her because she is moving away. If you don’t tell her now it’ll just be a more uncomfortable conversation later down the road. [Practical Advice]"
"I (22F) have been talking to this guy (21M) for about a week and a half. I’ve met up with him twice, our personalities mesh well, we text everyday and he always wishes me a good morning. I asked him on Wednesday if he was free to meet up on Sunday. He said “hell yeah”. So on Saturday I texted him to confirm the plans for Sunday and he said that “something came up” and he ended up hanging out with some of his friends that were leaving for college to take summer classes. While I understand that we only recently just met and I am not a priority, I can’t help but feel upset by this. He ditched me knowing we had made plans, didn’t apologize for the sudden change of plans, and didn’t offer an alternative date to hang out. I’m not sure if I’m being overly sensitive or if my feelings are proportionate to the situation.  Would be a deal breaker for me - not the changing plans but leaving it until I asked the night before [Commentator's opinion]"
"So long story short, 6th of june we had unprotected sex. She is on birth control.
The thing is she is not really consistent with the BCs cause she always goes to volleyball training and ends at the evening and once she arrives home, she is too tired to even do anything she just sleeps. She would take the pill she missed on the next day and then yeah.

Now, she just had a breakthrough bleeding (spotting) and we are both anxious cause of the “what ifs”

I didn’t finish inside her so it lessens the chances.

She doesn’t wanna take a pregnancy test because shes too scared to.

"I will go first; leave if the energy is not being reciprocated and don't make others convince you that your boundaries are negotiable It took me forever to realize this: 

Don’t place someone at a higher value than yourself. 

When you start seeing someone new, and feel a connection that you haven’t felt for a while, it’s so easy to fall hard and fast for them. BUT, when/if they start to pull away - let them pull away. 

Don’t play hard to get, but just act and tell yourself to be unbothered. If they don’t reply, or start ghosting - let them. If they come back because they realize that you’re someone who values yourself and won’t be a doormat, that’s amazing. If they don’t come back, also amazing because it’s a clear indicator that you were giving more than them, and that the relationship would have been 80-20. [Commentator's opinion]"
"My ex and I had an amazing relationship. We were both head over heels for each other. We dated for just under a year but had a serious relationship. We had talked about kids (including names), where we would buy our house, living together, and even a proposal/marriage (including where/when we would be married). 

8 months ago we broke up after living together for a month. She essentially didn’t see me a life partner over some things I did, mainly not fixing her toilet at midnight when I was already asleep, going to bed later then her, and being on my phone at breakfast a few times. I honestly think their was more to it, something deeper either consciously or unconsciously that drove her to break up with me. She wasn’t able to communicate it to me well. When we broke up we both walked away. Nether of us really fought for one another. 

10 days after breaking up with me she started dating her ex from 8 years ago (who cheated on her). They are now in a serious relationship and she’s again talking about marriage, kids, a house with the new boyfriend (they have been together for 6 months). She told me that her current relationship has a lot issues and barriers they are trying to fix. But she has been texting me a lot, probably 400-500 texts between the two of us last week. I don’t know if this is a sign she’s into me, being friendly, or keeping me as a back up. 

The other issue was that her parents were incredibly rude and disrespectful to both my self and my family, which would be a barrier we would have to discuss/talk about.

Any thoughts? Sorry she did that to you man. Let her be miserable with her ex and stay away from her. She made the decision to get back with him and it’s not your job to be the comforting side guy. Right now you are in the worst position as a man. You are the ex-turned-gay best friend 

If I had to guess she is texting you because you actually are a nice dude but she still has attraction for the “toxicity” of her ex, and she is using you solely for comfort and reassurance that she desperately wants from him. If that’s the case she has severe issues. I am sorry man, just move on. Find someone that loves you for you and who isn’t like this. [Emotional Support]"
"Background: 
My girlfriend and I have been dating since we met in orientation week of undergrad in 2017. We broke up in Nov 2020 due to a variety of reason but mainly centered around both of our poor coping strategies from childhood trauma. 

We rekindled our relationship in Jan 2023 after working on our problems apart. After dating long distance for 6 months we moved in together. 

The relationship has been mostly harmonious but there has been two issues that have been getting worse recently. 

The problem:
The first is that her ADHD has created a dynamic where I feel like I have to constantly keep track of housework/chores/bills as her executive disfunction prevents her from reliably self starting activities. This has lead to fatigue and burnout on my end and a dilemma of struggling to moderate my negative feelings as I do understand this is a disorder she also is dissatisfied with her inability to keep on top of her tasks.

The second is that her financial literacy is slowly draining me. After we broke up she dropped out of undergrad but still took on $19k in student loans. Mind you, I worked multiple jobs concurrently while in undergrad to only take $7k of student loans that I’ve paid down to a balance of $1500 after graduating. 

This gets into the bulk of the issue which is her financial literacy. The problem is that she has not paid any of it back and regularly will spend her checking account down to nothing and need me to send her money to keep her from over drafting. 

If it was legitimate needs like food I would understand but from what I see, she has a clothing shopping addiction and spends over what she can afford. She has stated to put $600 of clothing on affirm, and regularly thrifts for cloths even though our bedroom is overrun  with her clothing she already has. 

Once she gets her paycheck I would say she repays about 60-80% of what she needed me to cover but simply put she doesn’t earn enough to reliably cover her lifestyle. 

To her credit she is usually good about paying her portion of rent and bills but she only does so retroactively after it’s all due which means I’m on the hook to have the money needed to cover everything up front which has been hard lately with the cost of everything going up. 

Conclusion: 
I really do love her and want to stand by her doing anything I can. However, her lack of action to address these issues is slowly making me feel like a servant in the relationship. Sometimes I wake up in panics thinking about how if we get married then I’ll probably be on the one paying back her student loans while also being the only one trying to save up for our shared goals such as buying a house. 

TLDR:
How do I get her to take her financial literacy more seriously? Seems like she needs re-evaluation of her ADHD treatment plan because it sounds very poorly managed right now. Classes are going to be a waste until that is dealt with [Commentator's opinion]"
"I’m 33, My wife of 12 years recently decided we should split up, I have a 5 year old son who I share custody with and I have had a vacectomy as I don’t want any more children.

"hello friends,

when i was a junior in college i befriended this freshman. we were very platonic, just got lunch and chatted semi frequently. now, i have graduated and im 22. this summer we are hanging out a bunch, and we went to an 18+ emo club / party and ended up holding hands and being very intimate. i confessed to that i was developing feelings for her and she said she felt the same way too. i feel conflicted about continuing, considering that i am in soon going to be a salaried public school teacher in less than a year (have to get my student teaching done first) and she will still be in college and figuring her life out. 

it should also be noted that she has been in many relationships before and just got out a really abusive one a couple months ago. i, have never been in a relationship and feel comparatively immature for my age. at the same time, i wonder if i am selling myself short / holding myself back from growth. i have often felt like i wanted more time to figure things out in college, but i didn’t expect this to happen!

EDIT: also, we live relatively near each other this summer, but when she goes back to college she will be 90 minutes away. I swear we're fast getting to the point where we're going to see ""is 3 months too much of an age gap"" on here. [Hurtful]"
"Been with BF for year and a half now. 

BF’s younger cousin came over during the weekend for a visit. They haven’t seen each other for quite a while.  Generally had a good time, but I noticed tiny moments where he ‘kinda’ left me out especially when the three of us are walking together. He would walk and speak to her and I would try and keep up with the pace but generally stays out of the conversation. 

When it’s time for her to head back, we walked her to the station. Halfway through the journey I had to slow down my pace cause I’m tired, they keep walking ahead and not once my BF looked back to check whether I’m keeping up with them or not. 

I kept to my slow pace but I can’t stop thinking about how if I just stopped walking my BF probably wouldn’t notice at all until his cousin point it out. Tbf we’re in a bit of a rush, but we did arrive 10mins early.

This happened once too when his parents came for a visit and he just walked ahead of his parents and leave me walking behind his parents. His parents took better care of me by not having me walked alone behind them.

To be clear I do not place any blame on his cousin at all, she’s super lovely and I’m really glad she came over. But her visit does make these moments stand out and starting to make me question my relationship with BF. 

When it’s just the two of us he doesn’t do that at all. It’s just when his family is around, even then it’s not often.

I just feel so hurt when I’m made aware of these little things, that I questioned whether he cares if I’m around or not, whether he even considers me as his GF, or even if he loves me,  and I want to communicate this to BF but doesn’t want to make a fight out of it. 

Any advice on how to do that? 
 Men are dubious at times. He may not even realize what he's doing.  The only way he will know that it bothers you is if you tell him.  

""Hey babe, you probably dont realize this, but I just want to let you know that when you walk fast ahead of me, I feel ignored and left out. Please try not to leave me behind again. It hurts my feelings."" [Practical Advice]"
"
I’ve been in a relationship for about 4 years now with an amazing girl! Truly is my best friend. The most loyal and caring human being towards me! Only thing is I don’t have that spark for her and I never really did. I know she is head over heels for me and honestly that’s why I have been with her for so long. We now own property together and our lives are twisted together. 

I was out of town this weekend on a business trip and I met this woman at a bar and when I tell you I didn’t know what hit me when i saw her. We talked and the chemistry and spark was instant. I felt bad for leading her on and eventually told her I had a fiancé. She seemed very bummed but we kept in contact for the next few days. I truly believe I may have met my soulmate. I mean I was left gasping for air when she would turn away. I have never felt that level of attraction in my life. 

I now am contemplating leaving my fiancé but I don’t seem how I can come out of that ok. I love her family and she loves mine. We have already started to building a life together and idk how I can justify throwing all that away for a woman I barely know. 

I am on here to seek advice and learn from others stories if they have been in a situation similar to mine. 


 As an older man who has gone through the shit storm many a times in my life.....

Trust me.... It's not worth it.

Not trying to be the moral police here. But, life is long and 20 years down the line you still realize that it's a blessing to have someone who loves you more than you love your self. If you got family that loves you from her side, that's a massive plus as well. Simple advice I can give you is that ""you can burn anything and everything including the whole world...but never burn your home and the one that makes your house a home""

Saying that....as said..been through enough shit storms

So.,sure...letting this ""soulmate"" go will leave you with a 1st year serious regret, 2nd year of random regret and a 3rd year of seldom regret and a 4th year of ""once a year"" regret and 5th year of you will never remember her again. That much I can confidently impart with you.

Still if you want to pursue it, well..be kind to your girlfriend and break it off right now. Even keeping in contact with your supposed ""soulmate"" right now is a form of cheating. Then go full throttle guns blazing at your new interest keeping your fingers crossed on that shit working out for you on the long run. 

Basically it boils down to a simple choice mate. Either you keep your win and walk away or take a leap of faith and gamble everything you have built in your life. 

Choice is yours as there's no set methods or established protocols to follow here.

"I was at a wedding this weekend, and while there were some things that went well ( got to dance with a girl and got her number at the end of the night) I did some very awkward things looking back on it and probably ruined my chances. Every time I have some sort of social interaction that isn’t normal or expected, I look back on it and cringe bc I do something weird or awkward like putting my name in her phone as A-a-Ron instead of being normal and putting Aaron, or leaning into a picture that someone was taking that in hindsight I don’t think I was meant to be part of, and probably other things like that. I can usually get a date or a number on occasion, but I tank my chances once people talk to me or text me or interact with me for a long enough time period. I’m tired of giving myself second hand embarrassment from doing cringe stuff, what can I do to help this? It makes me not want to do anything social because I’m tired of embarrassing myself  ""A-a-Ron"", nice deep cut reference of a classic Key & Peele sketch.

Anyway, as a somewhat socially awkward man (I don't feel that way, but have been perceived that way), you just need to learn how to find your people. 

You'll eventually learn how to spot the people who ""get it"", versus the ones that don't. [Commentator's opinion]"
"Title says it. My pregnant wife  went to the ends of the earth to start a fight over anything she could. She'd even make up stories and fight with me as if they were real.

I'm actually a really good guy and am so inlove with her I'll never unstand this, but she did all this so she can feel like running to another man 9 months pregnant is justified.

"Posted before. Struck up what I thought was an amazing friendship with someone. 3 weeks we talked so much shared so much and then out of nowhere ghosted. No indication anything was wrong. Felt like we had a connection where at least if either of us were no longer interested in talking there was enough connection respect and caring there to at least say hey this isn't working or something.

"I'm going through a shitty breakup and needing advice about the lessons that I should have learned or what I could have done better. Our main problems were poor communication, unresolved depression/sleeping/mental health issues of one partner, empathy burnout, dishonesty (but eventual honesty), and lack of/respect for boundaries with each other and with platonic friends. Our strong relationship qualities were VERY strong-great sense of humor/banter, share similar interests/hobbies, same tastes in food, film, books, etc, BEST SEX OF MY WHOLE LIFE, same principles/value, and a deep, deep love and care for one another.   
First big problem-our communication got really bad -just yelling and finger pointing with no actual problem solving. He (30 M) screaming and cursing me in public and me (34 F) finally losing my temper to the point I threw a giant cup at him. I'm enrolled in weekly DBT class after this incident and he moved out of the house.   
The next issue was my partner's ongoing depression, anxiety, weight gain, and sleeping issues going unresolved for two years, and getting worse once he began night shift. I tried at the beginning to help as best I good, which caused me to get empathy burnout and start to turn cold/disinterested when he would express his problems or I would start to nag him. As he does not take criticism very well and I do not handle empathy burnout well, it was a bad dynamic leading to several breaking -up-and-getting back together death cycles.  
The next problem was dishonesty. On one of our breaks, I slept with my friend and lied about it (that ""friend"" told me I should lie because it would cause a rift in the friends group-whole 'nother story right there). I lied at first then could not take it anymore and came clean that I slept with my friend while we were broken up. My partner lied about getting escorts twice during each of our major breaks-he eventually came clean as well. He had also gotten escorts before dating me, but did not tell me this when we began dating. I still am not over the hurt caused by him getting escorts and he still is SO ANGRY and not over that I slept with my friend.   
Good parts-I love him very very dearly and sincerely wished this was the ""love to end all loves"". I could see my self growing old with him, with both of us hunkering down and doing the therapy-but we never got that far. What could I have done differently? What can I do differently next time? This was such a heartbreak and I feel like maybe if we had really gotten to know each other first before moving so quickly, we could have sorted out some of these red flags? What are other successful couples' secrets to success? You say that you both lied and then came clean later. Did you lie to his face multiple times? Get defensive and deflect blame? Did your partner have difficulty trusting you with this male friend while you were together? Did you and this male friend have a past together? How did you respond when your partner voiced concern about this male friend in the past? Were you honest with him about your feelings for that friend? Was there a love triangle when you first started dating that you later denied? If you immediately slept with this male friend when you were single, was it fair to your partner that you were spending alone time with this friend while you were together?
Your ex probably now feels that your “friend” was always on standby. Either your friend was the backup plan or your partner was your second choice all along. He feels so deeply betrayed that he knows he will never trust you again, and wonders what else you lied about. 
In regards to the nagging. If you can’t meet someone where they’re at and love them for who they are, leave them alone. [Commentator's opinion]"

"I 28F have been seeing this guy 35M for about two and half months. We had great chemistry from date one, and have maintained consistent communication and time together though we both have jobs that require travel and long hours some days - we’ve made it work nonetheless. We’ve done no sleepovers or anything significant, however recently he’s started sharing more about his child (which I knew about from day 1). I’ve never dated someone with a kid, however I knew it was significant for him to start sharing and he even said it was. He’s also told me on his own volition that he really likes me and wants to be more intentional about us and our time together. I asked if that came with exclusivity as we have been intimate and I personally have not sought others and wanted to make sure we were on the same page. He agreed he too was not interested in others but the rest of his message really bummed me out. He basically said it was just me and his kid in his life right now but that he ultimately doesn’t know what he he wants and if he wants anything at all and that he’s just playing things by ear….. i didn’t make a fuss of things but I was genuinely confused. He said that he only as that I let him know if I start hooking up with and seeing someone else. Am I crazy or is that mixed signals? I feel like it’s a bit unfair to say we’re exclusive but that he wasn’t sure if it was moving anywhere… I stated early on that I ultimately was looking for a LTR. But I currently feel like I’m in some sort of relationship limbo and could be missing out on someone who isn’t confused or unsure about where we stand. Is that asking for too much after almost 3 months of getting to know someone?

"So we became a thing when I was 16 and she was 30. I believe I was groomed but at the time I didn’t realize it that I was being used. People warned me but I didn’t want to believe it. 

A few years later I realized how fucked up my life is.

I graduated high school early for her, lost friends and didn’t keep in touch with anyone. Dropped out of college for an online school that I rushed through just so I could be with her. She was “aging and needed to get married soon or she’d have to leave me” which I guess she tried.  

Now I have a degree that’s practically meaningless. Never got the college experience, in debt from spending money on trips, no social life or friends and I have trouble interacting with people, socially awkward. 

Now she’s saying she’s proud of where I am and how I am focusing on myself. I believe she has no right to say that to me when she ruined and took years of my life that were or should have been the most important.

Now she can’t do anything to help me or make things better but she sure can help me financially. Is it wrong for me to ask her for a couple grand? 

Like I know the better thing would be to move on but I find it soo disheartening and infuriating that she can easily say I’m proud of you and move on. While her life was never impacted this significantly compared to mine. 

What should I do? I told her tonight I find it difficult to hear or accept that from her. When in actuality it’s her fault. The challenges I face daily, parts of my life I never to go experience and make memories of.
 
She goes I guess it’s best to cut contact as she’s moved on and realized choices were made on both ends. That she doesn’t appreciate the victim game. 

What do you guys think? You can’t really move on,all you can do is forgive yourself for it and try to be a better person than you were yesterday, groomers will never realize how much they took from you, you can go to the police for statutory rape depending on state you live in. They always move on with their life’s as if we are nothing, leave you to pick up the pieces. You can sure ask her for a few grand but I wouldn’t bother it just gives them a reason to stick around longer. [Commentator's opinion]"
"My bf and I have been dating for a couple years. He tried to date a girl beforehand who wasn’t sexually compatible so they decided to be platonic friends. I find out that he drove her down the road to see the eclipse together, then they went to his house and laid on the trampoline with pillows and blankets (opposite end of the trampoline, my boyfriend said) talking and looking up at the stars. This girl did not know I even existed though. We met - I think because we had to because our paths were going to emerge - and she casually mentioned the hangout. 


My boyfriend said they were just hanging out as friends, and she was going through a rough time so he was there for her. And they went on the trampoline because he didn’t have chairs outside, and put down blankets because the trampoline was dirty. And he asked me then if he was allowed to have female friends on the trampoline.

He doesn’t really like me bringing it up (I’ve brought it up 2 or 3 times), says that I overthink, and that we talked about it once and that should be good.  That's literally the love of his life . Girl please be for real. [Commentator's opinion]"
"My boyfriend and I have been together a little over 3 years. There has been plenty of ups and downs, as any relationship entails. While I came name off a number of things he's done wrong, I don't think it has much to do with why I want to leave. I see things a lot differently than he does, and he is going to think I am running away. I believe I am trying to run towards something new and life-changing. It's been on my mind for months now, and I even have all initial and monthly costs planned out. 

I cannot keep repeating this cycle I am currently in. I know I will be unhappy if I continue. I just don't know how much longer I should wait. I also have obligations here, should that stop me? 

I am grateful for everything he has done, but I don't think I am satisfied here. Everyday is the same. I always have a feeling in my gut telling me to leave. He doesn't want to change, he wants to keep me by his side forever. I know for a fact he feels this way because of all the sobbing and pain about me leaving him. I think this is also my fault, as I comfort him in my arms, lying to him. I don't know what is keeping us together anymore, because I have started to detach myself more and more. We have talked about this multiple times, his or my behavior and how it can change. But I am no longer interested in trying to change him, I can only change myself.

I have meditated and weighed out the options for hours on end, but I'm still stuck. There are other factors that bring me to these conclusions, not just my boyfriend. I'm trying to be as logical as I can before I make such an impulsive decision.

First, I have a cat. I love her to death and I'm not sure I could take her because I plan to live out my car. Second, my car is not the best. It needs a lot of work because it is older. Third, I am legally obligated as a bond co-signer to monitor my boyfriend (a crazy story lmao). Last, I'm not sure he would survive on his own. What would any of you do in this situation? Is it time for me to embark on this journey or should I wait longer until I am fully prepared? I should also note that I have a reliable amount of income working from home.  Well it sounds like you have a legal obligation you need to address. Then you need to rehome your cat. And you need a new car. 

Personally, I think you better sort the legal discreetly first and see what your options are. Then I’d plan to move out while you sort the other items but before travel. [Practical Advice]"
"Basically there's a newer coworker at the reception who's very shy and reserved. Barely says anything to anyone, no eye contact whatsoever. She won't even say hello unless you say it first. That type of thing.

I had a basic conversation with her but it wasn't really going anywhere ( could be that she's at work or not comfortable talking at work ). I left her to her own devices since I'm not really getting the vibe that she's interested at all. I'm not a pushy person.

Is it ill advised to just rip off the bandage and ask her if she wants to grab a coffee sometime and if it's a no, just respectfully say "" No hard feelings, totally understand "" and remain polite and professional from that point onwards or should I not even bother? Just keep getting to know her at work. You want some signs of interest before you ask them out. [Practical Advice]"

4) (i am pretty middle class wont go above zara or hnm) wont stop talking about how rich her father is … makes me feel how small i am 


I have discussed all these problems with her … it stops for a while and creeps up again … if i discuss it again she cries and wont stop until i give up and say its okay..or she has some perspective in which i am wrong somehow and she is the victim

My boyfriend cheated on me, and after that, our relationship was never the same. I discovered that he was seeing another girl and talking to three more on Tinder. He had been using Tinder for three months while he was with me. I decided to forgive him. After he cheated on me, he constantly accused me of being unfaithful, controlled me, and asked me to send pictures. I agreed, but the problem was that he didn’t reciprocate. On Thursday, I found him walking with a girl; I knew she was his friend, but I still got angry and didn't text him all night because he didn't tell me he was going to do that, and he always demanded that I do those things. After that, he stopped talking to me for two days, until today when he decided to break up with me. His reasons: because I’m insecure, controlling, and jealous. I want to add that he invited me to lunch today and brought his mom. I couldn’t talk to him about anything except when his mom got up to order food. At that moment, he said, “We have nothing more to talk about. We’re done.” I feel somewhat frustrated by everything, and I feel it’s my fault for being jealous on Thursday and that nothing is right. Is this my fault? Because I think I am guilty.

I want to add that this is very painful for me, but the relationship was suffocating me financially. He was very demanding with gifts and food, liked to eat at expensive places, and I usually treated him, spending all my money on him every month. That suffocated me a lot, and I accepted the breakup just because of that. Financially, he left me in a very bad place. Do you think I should write to him and ask to fix things? What should I do? I don’t know what to do from now on. It's bananas. He sounds like the worst. He cheats on you, sucks up your money, and you want to go back to him? I don't understand. Am I missing something?

 A few things for me (26m)
1. Trying to get me to sub to something (onlyfans, fansly, etc.) It shows you already assume that I'm only sex minded, and that's not an energy I can start or continue a convo on
2. One word responses that don't give me room to move the conversation. If I ask you a question, give me more than, ""yes"" or ""I guess"" so that we can actually talk

I have been liking his stories and just now I liked a note that he posted, but when I did, I genuinely felt nauseated and disgusted and nervous. I would love to be in a relationship with the guy, but the whole process of starting over on a new person and getting them to start talking to you is so nerve wracking. 
I talk to other girls my age and they seem to be able to have a new guy they snap every week, but I just cant. I never talk to guys I dont know, nor do I want to.

"For a brief background, we've been dating/going out together for 4 months. He asked me what I wanted for our relationship, so I said I needed to know if we were on the same page before making any decisions. This morning, he admitted he likes me, and I told him I like him too. But then he said, ""We're clear now? Then I'll go to sleep,"" which disappointed me. It felt like we should discuss what happens next after his confession. Am I expecting too much, which is why I'm disappointed? Now, his messages seem a bit distant, or maybe I'm just overthinking things. the fact you call him saying he likes you already a confession says you're expecting too much. life isn't an anime. were you hoping for fireworks to go off randomly in the background and for him to pin you against the wall and start making out with you?
he seems distant now because you confronted him on it and told him he needs to tell you his feelings. [Commentator's opinion]"

I am in a long-distance relationship. We are very much in love with each other. She has a very high sex drive so we sext often, which I love to do. We have a great relationship outside one thing: she has a pretty massive kink for NTR or “cuckolding”.

She brought it up several times and wants to involve me in it. Basically, it’s been a long time since she’s been intimate with someone and yearns for it. She’s been wanting to hook up with a guy, just once, and text me during. She is fine with almost any condition I set for it. She doesn’t want any kissing during, he will be blindfolded, etc.

I have some relationship experience but none were with this high sex-drive nor with such a kink. I can tell it means a lot to her but she told me she would never do it if it makes me sad.

I’d rather not do it at all, personally. I know no feelings are involved so it’s less jealousy, but I don’t want her to unconsciously compare my performance to some other guy. But I know this will mean she’ll just be pent up, especially given our current distance. She assured me it would be a one time thing and I’d be very involved.

I think, if I can set some conditions down, I might be willing to do it *just once*. I’d especially rather agree to it because, shitty as I am to think that, her hypersexuality is to the point where she’d either be miserable, or she’d go ahead and do it quietly. I’d rather at least be *involved* if she does.

I wanted to ask this for experienced kinky people: if you had such a kink, would you be satisfied with just one time? Did you ever end up comparing your partner’s performance to whoever you indulged in this cuckold kink with? How did it affect your relationship? OP, this is just a way for her to have sex with other guys, and have you on board with it. You should refuse to participate, and tell her it makes you highly uncomfortable. Tell her if it comes up again, the relationship is over.

Tell her you would like to have sex with other women, and have her watch. Ask her if she is on board with that. [Practical Advice]"

-I’m definitely not looking for a hookup. 
-I’m not necessarily dating to marry, as in, I’m not in any hurry. I feel like any version of “I’m looking for something serious” is way too much pressure. I would be open to something serious with the right person. 
-It would be nice to go on dates and get to know someone if I find anyone that seems interesting and compatible. That is casual to me. If something serious develops from that, awesome! If not, maybe we can be friends or just go our separate ways, but hookups or fwb or situationships are still fully off the table. 

I feel like, to me, my intention is to date casually and see where that goes. But, to most men (at least most men on dating apps), something casual is synonymous with hookups. I’m not gonna have sex with someone I’m not dating. 

I don’t know how to make sure expectations are clear for everyone.  Pressure for who? [Not Relevant]"
"I don’t even know where to begin with this but I’ll try to be as short as possible with giving the full story. 

I’m 26 and my girlfriend is 24. We’ve been together for a little over two years. Living together for a year. 
We have a very active sex life, usually every day or every other day.  She was my first. I wasn’t her first but that’s ok. So it’s safe to say I watched a lot of porn before I got into a relationship. 

We talked about it in the beginning of our relationship. She didn’t seem to have an issue. She watches it too. She just said no onlyfans because her ex cheated on her with an only fan model. I said ok. And we went about our relationship. Until we decided to watch porn together as a couple. At first she seemed fine, then she just walked away and said she wasn’t into it. 

She told me she saw the look on my face, and she doesn’t like that. And I guess ever since we moved in together, she stopped watching porn. She told me “I’m satisfied with you. I don’t need to watch it. It doesn’t do it for me anymore” 
I said I don’t watch it as often anymore either. And that was that. 

We started getting into dirty conversation, and once again. Porn came up. I mentioned that I look up instagram girls OF usernames so I can watch it on Reddit or another platform. I’m not paying. I’m not interacting. So I thought it was ok. 

I asked last week if she wanted to find a “JOI video for couples” (for those who don’t know, it’s a video of a woman instructing somebody how to pleasure themselves. It’s been something I’ve always liked. And she’s bisexual. 

She said “no” and said she wasn’t in the mood anymore. I said “even if it was a hot older woman???” She said no again and walked away. We talked after she she said that she doesn’t like how specific I am with my porn. As in looking up nudes of specific actresses and such. And that it makes her feel like she’s not enough when we have adventurous sex. 

I watch it wayyyy less than before. I just brought it up again months and months after because my girlfriend mentioned JOI. Her telling me what to do in person. That’s why I suggested one we could both watch. I don’t look up specific porn stars anymore and I don’t understand how it’s different than watching porn. It’s all just out of curiosity. 

Now she’s debating everything.  OK, the OF thing - nice try, slick, but this is a relationship not a debating society, technicalities don’t win they just make you look sneaky 

On the rest: I get not being cool with you being into specific porn people, that becomes a very direct comparison between that person and her, which is not a nice feeling. More generally, people can have *really* specific porn tastes that may also depend contextually on a thousand other things going on at the time, it may literally just be that she’s not into specifically what you’re into

What she said about the “look on your face” makes me think she perceives your response to porn to be objectifying. And on the one hand, it’s porn, of course it’s objectifying. But at the same time, she (presumably) thinks of you as a respectful person who sees her - and by extension all women - as a whole person. Seeing you in “porn mode” may have been quite jarring to her perception of you

Honestly I’d just stop trying to share it, clearly that’s not working for her [Commentator's opinion]"
"So im a 20 year old guy and i literally never talked to a girl for longer than 5 minutes, unless it was a family member or they were at their job (dentist).


Now i started ""dating"" by using instagram, dating apps and approching in real life but it just doesnt seem to work.

Now you might say i should work on myself but the problem is that im already doing that:
Without sounding arrogant i would say that i have an athletic physique, i dress good, i smell good, my face isnt to bad either and im quiet confident.

Besides money i dont know what else i should change about myself and i dont want to lower my standarts even more.
What should i do? You are only 20.

"Not sure if this is the right sub but it deals with “dating” so here I go.

I(30f) have been friends with Sam(35m) for 3 years, we recently stepped in the next stage of “talking”. He is very sweet,but one thing I cannot get over is his lack of financial planning.

Sam lives in the country and rent is no more than $550-$600 with utilities/car insurance included he pays no more than $900 a month. I live in the city and pay 2x that amount. I make good money but I am also very cheap and know how to save/spend. Sam eats out EVRYDAY. I have talked to him about his spending habits, eating at home VS eating out everyday. It’s gets nowhere

Recently I just got the ICK when he asked me for $3 and said he will pay me back. We got into an argument because of this like come tf on bro. Few days go by and TODAY he asks if I could buy him groceries for him and his daughter. Like $40 worth. 

Would I be wrong to buy them and then block him?

Ps he makes decent money to live where he is at. He could be saving $500-700 a month but as I stated very bad with money.  Nope, I can see where you're coming from and it'll just continue to happen if you stay with him. [Practical Advice]"
"I think the main reason I am writing this is in the off chance he will he will see which is absolutely pathetic but hey guess I’m pathetic right now.

When I say husband, it’s only bc we can’t get divorced yet. If I refinance then it will double my mortgage and I can’t pay that but I kicked him out years ago we soon as I found out but but he was fully in love with her and despite acting like he was still seeing her, they are (SHOCKER) together still.

I want to be in a chill place for our son who is five. But he talks to me with such a nasty tone like he hates me. He was my best friend years and absolutely amazing the first few years when I found out. I was hospitalized a month after we got married and within the day I went in I was diagnosed and quickly paralyzed from left side, waist up. For years I struggled so bad and we were youngrt. It was hard on us but I was getting better and I thought we could fall back in love but by then he was gone. 

I’ve forgiven him but this hurts worse than cheating. I got angry bc our son called him and the mistress was making noises when she heard my voice that it seemed disrespectful and just. I blew up his phone after and he blocked me but it’s been weeks and he will change his work schedule and his or my mom tells me. WHY!?

I didn’t do anything to him and I’m doing so well, nearly back to normal. My neurologist said the case baffled him and I even started my own marketing agency recently and… the guy had not once asked how I am. 

When I blow up I get real nasty. I know. I’m so hurt and I don’t want him as a husband (ew gross)) but I do want to coparent well for our son and it’s impossible if he is so nasty/acts like I don’t exist. When I found out I kicked him out hurt he came over all the time bc it was good for our son and honestly I was okay bc by the time I found out I felt relief. I realized he had been really horrible to me but I was so sick/tired I didn’t react. I trusted him more the myself so I just internalized everything. For 8 years he was seemingly the sweetest man. He can this be the same guy? 

Someone make it make sense!
 Cognitive dissonance is the answer. He knows cheating on you while you were sick is a scummy low-down thing to do. He is an awful person UNLESS you were a witch and a terrible wife before you got sick. He has probably rewritten history in his own mind and convinced his AP that they aren't really bad people because the marriage was already over. The way he treats you is a reflection of his newly created really. Kill him with kindness. If he will not meet you halfway on creating a schedule, it isn't your fault when he doesn't get his time as a result. Wait for him to text you or get an app to communicate. His AP is probably super paranoid because she knows everything they did while you were still together. I bet she is monitoring the communications. [Practical Advice]"
"I've been dating a guy for 6 months. His birthday was last month and I spent almost $200 on gifts that would be personal to him. My birthday was last week. He wished me a happy birthday via text and that was it. He told me he got me a ""small gift"" but never gave it to me after seeing him 3 times since. 
I got really emotional over the week and told him I didn't think we should be together. He didn't seem to care. 


My friends were furious when they heard he got me nothing, as they know I was making the effort to buy him his gifts online and to make sure I got it in time for his birthday. 

Was I expecting too much? I told him I would have appreciated even a rock by the river.  Never spend that much money for the first gift unless you have no expectations the value would be matched. Not worth it for someone you known for 5 months dating wise. It’s okay to have expectations but given his lack of response or care I’d drop him [Practical Advice]"
"You guys were absolutely right I should not have touched him when he asked me to stop. I really think I made this situation way worse.

Relevant information I forgot to include in my panicked state: we are both people who have been sexual assaulted multiple times and have PTSD from it.

I think if this was flipped and he kept touching me as someone who had been SAed and I choked him, no one would have batted an eye. 

Additionally, in the last few days he has set up an appointment to get medication, he had his first session with a therapist, and got diagnosed with Autism. 

This makes a lot of sense. I think he was having an autistic meltdown and then I triggered his PTSD on top of that. It still obviously doesn't make his reaction okay, but it makes it explainable.

We are taking some time separate to work on ourselves and our own mental health. We have had some really productive conversations. 

I am definitely going to keep my hands to myself going forward because I escalated this situation.

We've agreed that if anything like this were to ever happen again, that's a hard line for both of us and I'm moving out immediately.

I also tested him twice which maybe isn't the best thing, but I wanted to gauge his reaction for my own safety. I asked him if he'd go to anger management classes and he said if I thought it would help that he absolutely would. 

I also acted as if I had finally decided to move out, and he calmly accepted that and asked if he could help me out.

Ultimately I know the statistics. However I really think this was a case of some serious undiagnosed and untreated mental health. I'm going to give it another go and check in regularly with the people around me. He has also shared what happened with family and is being honest about the situation. As someone who has worked in the domestic violence field for 10 years, you received some really, really problematic advice on your last post. A very large percentage of commenters in this sub do not have the personal or professional experience to appropriately and adequately respond to domestic violence posts, and this is yet another example of that.

Nothing you said or did led to him strangling you. This was a choice. Strangulation is not reactive abuse. Just because your behavior was not okay does not mean this should be solely chalked up to a PTSD response or a mental health breakdown. You said it makes his behavior explainable, but any domestic violence professional worth their salt would not agree with this. There is more going on here than this, and redditors without experience in this topic cannot untangle that safely.

I am going to leave it there. If you want advice that is not dangerous and that will take into account the whole situation, talking to a domestic violence advocate is far more advisable than relying on reddit, though I understand why you did so and I totally get it.

"So recently I broke up with my boyfriend who I had been with for 3 months because I felt like he just didn't respect me. He would tell me dirty jokes and wouldn't stop when I told him it bothered me. Generally, he always tried to blame me whenever I tried to communicate with him about what I didn't like in our relationship. I also feel like he just didn't make an effort because he knew I'd never had a boyfriend before, so he thought anything would satisfy me. When I was breaking up with him, I told him that I was going through a rough time and needed to focus on myself, mentioning his behavior as well, and he didn't even ask what was going on.

Now, 2 weeks after we broke up, he wants to try again, but the first thing he writes to me is that ""he saw on my Instagram stories that I'm having fun with my friend."" I told him that we can keep in touch, but I don't think there will be anything more to it. He keeps saying that we should try but I'm not having any of it. The problem is that I have low self-esteem and I feel like that's why he treats me this way...

I wish that everything could be good in our relationship but I just feel that he is not the person for me and that nothing will come of it, but I also don't want to write anyone off 100% and I really don't know what to do.

TDLR, I broke up with my boyfriend but he wants me back and I don't know if I should give him a chance. Stop talking with him . It doesn’t mean you hate him. But he seems to be just unhealthy. Work on yourself esteem. You seem to know you are worth more than being offered. [Practical Advice]"
"Hello! Maybe a bit of an oddball question but hopefully I can find some interesting answers here.

I find that on dating apps there are a lot of women with prompts such as: Looking for a man with masculine energy, We’ll get along if you take the initiative, and other different ways of expressing a grievance of the fact that they experience men these days aren’t exhibiting traits conforming to stereotypical gender roles.

I find it quite unattractive, and also I really don’t want to waste my time with these people, especially because I don’t really feel I identify with the stereotypical gender role of a man. I’m a bit careful and sensitive. I don’t like sports. I'm not a macho guy basically. I can take the initiative to a certain degree but it doesn’t sit right with me if I’m the only one expected to do it.

Great, then I simply don’t need to write to these people you may say. I don’t! That’s not the problem, I feel as if there’s a lot of people sharing these sentiments despite not having a prompt giving it away. So I was wondering if there’s any prompt or something else that I might add to my profile to scare away people that are only looking for men who fit into the stereotypical male role without also making myself sounding as if I’m making a big fuzz about it. I want to have positive prompts that don’t make me seem uptight or negative. I find that it would be hard to convey what I want without it seeming a bit prude?

Hope I'm making sense, advice would be great!

TLDR: Want to convey in my dating profile that I don't conform to stereotypical gender roles without sounding like a prude. I am really into guys like you, and I'd say it is often visible in their pictures. As in like posture, cloth but also pics of hobbies.

You can also show that you are more on the sensitive side by writing a ""longer"" paragraph about yourself,  so then it kinda shows through you tone (as in your tone).

You can also just state, that you prefer non-traditional gender roles. You need to be careful about wording though or explain it a little,  so they don't confuse it with gender identity.

My personal go to to make sure to not attract matcho men: I have ""feminist "" in my bio. Works wonders. If you are a feminist, put that in there.

At the end of the day, you need to get yourself out their , meet people and just try to have fun, and see how it goes. If you sometimes attract the wrong person, that's normal. [Practical Advice]"
"I’ve been texting with this guy for about a month and a half, we hung out once after a couple weeks of talking and I had a great time and he said that he did too. After that I went out of town for a little over a week and we agreed to hang out again after I got back. However, for the last week or so he’s been taking longer and longer to reply to my messages. A few days after I returned from my trip I asked him if he was free anytime soon so we could plan something and he said he would be busy for the next week but should be free after that and would let me know. It’s coming up to the time that he’s supposed to be free and he’s made no mentions of making plans since then, I’ve been back for almost 2 weeks now. He has told me that he has a lot going on right now (he’s taking a lot of summer classes, is working, has some drama going on in his friend group and also some family issues that may cause him to have to move out soon) so I know that he’s currently struggling a little bit. There have been a few times when he’s taken a long time to respond that he apologized and said it was because he had a bad day due to everything going on. He’s never taken more than a full day to respond before, however as of right now it’s been almost 30 hours with no reply and (I know this might be a little crazy of me) I checked his snap score and saw that he’s been active on there. I know that he has a lot on his plate but now I’m starting to have doubts that he’s just using that as an excuse to distance himself. I’m worried that I may be overreacting since we haven’t been talking for very long, but I’m considering ending things the next time he texts me (if he ever does). I feel bad because of everything he’s dealing with right now, but it just doesn’t seem like he’s in a place currently to be talking to anybody and I would rather not waste either of our time. I don’t necessarily want to end things, he seems like a good guy, but again I just don’t know if he’s in the right position for anything romantic. I want to give him some grace because of his situation but am becoming more and more suspicious that that’s not the actual reason for the long response times.
tl;dr: Been texting this guy for a month and a half, hung out once and both said we had a great time. Said we would hang out again but he hasn’t made any effort to and is taking a long time to reply so I’m thinking of ending it. If he's juggling a lot, it could explain the slow replies, but actions speak louder than words. Maybe send a casual message like, ""Hey, hope you're doing okay! Still up for hanging out soon?"" If he doesn't respond or make plans, it might be time to move on. No need to wait around indefinitely. [Practical Advice]"
"Hello everyone. Hope you're all doing well. Just came seeking some advice. 

My girlfriend and I have been together for a little over two months, however, we've known each other for longer (we've spoken for over a year).

When we got together, I experienced a lot of anxiety, which I suspect to be ROCD (a form of OCD focused on relationships), but beyond that, everything has been perfect. 

She is everything I could've asked for in a partner, or at least I thought she was, until the other day. We were making out and she said, ""the thought of someone else doing this to you makes me want to stab them."" Previously, we had talked about me being a bit possessive, her claiming that she wasn't. So, given this, I asked: ""So you are a bit possessive, aren't you?"" Jokingly, of course. I can't remember exactly how it got to this point, but eventually, I asked: ""Could you see me with another girl?"" Everything is blurry beyond this moment. Somehow it led to her saying, ""I could see myself with another guy."" At first I didn't hear what she said, and then had to backtrack. She said it would be like a performance for me, and that all she wants it to make me happy/proud. In fact, her saying this did the exact opposite. Once she realized that, she began explaining that is was just a fantasy and that she might not even be interested in it at all. She began crying and saying that she never meant to hurt me and that she doesn't want to ruin our relationship, in which I assured her that everything was okay, but it's still at the forefront of my mind. 

She explained to me later that she is in fact monogamous and doesn't want anyone else, but I can't get the thought of my head. My ROCD doesn't help either, as it always ensures that I fixate on even the smallest things. I know she loves me, that's a fact. But now I'm questioning the credibility and longevity of our relationship. I just can't seem to let it go at the moment. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you. Everyone has different way of expressing their sexuality,  she was honest about a fantasy. It's important to accept that people will have fantasies and such, we can't control what others want. She also seems like she's cares about you with how she cried afterwards. Even with that fantasy, she can still love you as you mentioned. Many people have fantasies but don't act out on them. I would try to focus on enjoying what you have  life is short [Commentator's opinion]"
"I matched with a guy on tinder, and while my original intent was to have casual sex, I ultimately decided I want to meet up a few times before doing so. However, the man seems so obsessed with Sex. He wants me to dirty talk even though I stated that I’m uncomfortable with that. He was also disappointed over the fact that I changed my mind about jumping straight into sex. He kept asking if it’s something he did and insisted on being safe and good guy. I said it’s because we’re strangers and that it wasn’t anything he did. He kept asking the same questions over and over again and I just said “let’s just see how Wednesday goes” and left it as that and stopped responding to him. However, I am thinking about blocking him all together due to his reaction alone. I only matched with him 4 days ago and he is set on texting me every day all day since then. I feel like if he is this taken back by me setting my boundaries, what else would he be upset over? Am I in the wrong here??? Most men are obsessed with sex

"As the title suggests, I'm having trouble navigating these types of conversations about moving in with two female roommates: one is a loose friend of a friend, and the other is a personal friend. (I can't afford to live alone and to me, these two people seemed like the best fit for me.) For most of my life, I've had no trouble making opposite-gender friendships that are strictly platonic, but I acknowledge that perspective may not always be shared.

At the end of the day, I want to make my partner feel more secure about this situation. Has anyone had experience with this in the past, and how can I be simultaneously supportive and realistic of the situation at hand?  Well, if she's long-distance, this isn't going to be easy, but I've always found the best way to make your partner feel comfortable with your opposite-sex friends is to introduce them. Let them all get to know each other and possibly develop a friendship of their own, so they'll see they're no threat to them or your relationship. [Practical Advice]"

"He wasn't like this in the beginning, but as we got closer, he got more comfortable. It hasn't even been two months since we met, and I already told him how hurtful it is to be left on read. He apologized and promised to be more considerate, but he always uses the excuse, ""I'm always so busy"" (he works in private equity investments).

He asked me out for brunch today, but I wasn't feeling well, so I apologized and offered to do dinner after work on Monday. He said he's busy and suggested we rain check for next Sunday because he's going out of town mid-week. After that, he left me on read again.

"my friend just called me asking if i'd be upset if her and my dad got together. he's literally in his fourties and she's 18. they've apparently been talking back and forth and flirting for a while which is weird mostly because of his history.

He's VERY strict with me, who i date, my outfits i wear in public, and my past with me being abused and groomed multiple times. if i was out dating a 40 y/o and coming home to him and his teenage daughter he'd go INSANE. I was only adopted by him a year ago and didn't know him too well prior. he's been physically abusive (dragging, slapping, etc) but never sexual. it just feels weird but i dont know if it's weird or  abusive or anything? I guess my question is if I can do anything about this, if my friend is in danger, etc.  > I was only adopted by him a year ago and didn't know him too well prior

So this man was just a legal guardian to you for the past year?

Yeah, he isn't your dad. He's an abuser who is absolutely planning to abuse your friend as well. If you haven't, I would tell her that he's been physically abusive with you and that you would be extremely worried about her safety if she dated him.

I would also make a plan to get yourself away from this guy permanently. He's an abusive creep and NOT your family in any sense of the word. I'm sorry you've had these experiences. [Practical Advice]"
"I (20F) recently broke up with my boyfriend of 1 year (LDR) and three guys i knew IRL simultaneously entered my life. I have been sexually active with all three, ofc after letting them know I was. I’ve know them for a month, and guy #1 (23) wants to commit to monogamy since he realized he liked me too much to “keep it casual”, and I’m having a hard time deciding what i want. He feels uncomfortable that I’m meeting other people, and he said he wouldn’t be okay with seeing someone that didn’t choose him over seeing others. It’s understandable, but it puts me in a situation where I feel like i’m already prepping for a new relationship. On one hand, i’m newly single and seeing who I am most compatible with, but on the other, i do genuinely have a liking to him and he’s very caring. We had a deep conversation where i sobbed for 3 hours because I wasn’t sure what decision would be best for me. He’s everything that screams BF material, and i enjoy the time we have together. We’re also compatible, but i also have trauma with men becoming infatuated and then leaving. I also seem to be compatible with the other dudes I’m talking to, since all of them have told me that they’ve “never connected with someone like this before”. (You tend to hear that a lot as a woman.) I’m also very good friends with the other two guys i’m talking to, and i would also like the time to get to know them. I feel guilty and selfish for wanting to hang out with them more before committing. It also makes me sad that I won’t be able to be friends with them if I do commit, but I’m scared of losing guy #1. I'm genuinely so conflicted, and i dont know what i should do. 
 you're fresh out of a relationship so guy #1 might be a rebound. hes probably everything  your ex wasnt or doing things that your ex didnt.

"So we’ve had arguments about this one girl in the past who he said was just a friend to him, and I never believed it because their exchanges seemed flirty. He had been liking her photos and what not and I actually just requested that he doesn’t keep contact with her if he’s had a flirtatious relationship in the past. He denied her even touching her, but I’ve heard from other people that they actually slept together. Anyways, he removed her from Instagram. 

Last night we were laying in bed having our own screen time, and our phones touched so his contact card shared and under his emergency contacts it had her listed as “girlfriend”. 

I honestly flipped out and I was telling him he lied to me about her, not having been his girlfriend and he was saying she was never his girlfriend, and he doesn’t know how that got there, to stop asking questions about the past blah blah. 

I never intended to ask questions about his past before me, but it’s a lie that bothered me. I’m not sure if she was his girlfriend or not (they worked together), but every sign points to that she was and he can’t admit.  

After this, he got up and went to the couch to sleep for the first time in her marriage and hasn’t talked to me all day today. Part of me feels immature for making an argument out of this, but honesty is so crucial to me that I’m having a hard time letting this white lie slip. 

What’s the most mature way that I can approach this? He seems to not want to communicate with me at all, and honestly seems quite disgusted that I reacted the way that I did.   Your're married so presumably you share a phone plan. Log in to your online billing and look at activity under his number. it will show you what numbers he's texting, calling etc. You are not the problem here. [Practical Advice]"
"Hi! So l've been dating this guy for about a year now. He's a great guy but l've recently found out some things about him that if I knew then, I probably wouldn't have pursued our relationship.

My biggest concern now is I found out that he's taking steroid injections (250g/week) on/off for about two years now and he gets his supply from his friend who ""knows a guy"".. so yeah, it's unprescribed. I’ve talked to him about this before and explained my concern but he said he is taking it with caution so no need to worry. Problem is I can’t help but worry knowing that he’s taking it illegally and for quite a long time now and it’s solely to gain muscle better (he's a gym rat). 

I love my bf but this really throws me off. ☹️ Any advice on how I should go about our situation? Hmm, that would be a dealbreaker, I don’t care how much I loved him. It’s a boneheaded move that shows he’s more concerned about his “looks” than his overall health. I couldn’t love that. [Commentator's opinion]"
"hi there, i recently reached back out to an ex that i cut off contact with two years ago. he did something that really upset me, and i decided to set the boundary and block him and i hadn’t spoken to him until last month in two years. it’s hard considering him an ex because we were pretty young and the bulk of our relationship was during peak covid times. I had only met him in person a handful of times. I was 17 when i stopped speaking to him and am 19 now. He also went away for college last year and is home for the summer, we hung out today and I kinda realized speaking and chatting with him has made me feel those past feelings again. He was the first person I ever loved and I do have a soft spot for him. I didn’t initiate anything today because I was fearing rejection lol. Any advice on how to go about telling him how I feel? The stakes aren’t super high because it’s not like he’s become a super close friend or anything and we weren’t talking at all until about a month ago. I don’t think i’d want to have a full blown relationship since he is far away for school, but I’d like to share with him at a prospect of something maybe happening. Feel free to share any advice on how I can communicate this to him. If you have no intention of dating seriously, do you really want to offer your heart to him? [Commentator's opinion]"
"I'm going to say the most cringe thing on planet earth, however, I'm working on being less socially awkward and there's this cute Walmart employee I would like to ask out.

1. He's at least 4 years older than me. (Good, because that's my type but not very socially acceptable.)
2. I have a habit of being awkward and being far too intense.

I'm debating trying my luck and just going and asking, but I'm also very nervous.

He's just so cute and I get really excited and hyper. Why wouldn’t you try your luck? [Practical Advice]"
"i (23F) have officially deleted my dating profiles.

i quit.

ive been single for about 4 years now. i have been actively going on dates and meeting new people for over a year now. no luck. men just aren’t looking for relationships. i know that im attractive, smart, funny, caring, etc. i am relationship material. i have a lot to offer: the men ive dated have acknowledged this but they are all emotionally unavailable. you may ask, “why date guys that are aren’t available?”. to that i say, “why are unavailable guys on dating apps in the first place?”. 

the dating market is abysmal. great women and men alike are all struggling and it’s no coincidence why. dating in 2024 is a lost cause.

im hoping that me giving up is liberating as i say goodbye to the never-ending disappointment of dead end connections and rejection. maybe now i’ll shave my head. move overseas. become a nomad. i dont know! and it doesnt matter now!

good luck to you all still in this dating game. hope you can find what you’re looking for in this shit show.  Yeah it's really rough. I met this woman at a bar on Friday and absolutely hit it off with her. Within 5 minutes of talking to her she tells me she's in love with my personality and invites me to her place. I try to set up a real date with her the next day and I get hit with the ""I just got out of a relationship"" card. Shits rough out here. I really wish people were just up front with what they want.

"my girlfriend and i (2 years together) were renting a house with roommates and we both have been unhappy with the living situation. so we planned to both move back in with our parents to save money to buy our own house. 

she already moved in with her mom for about a month and was able to get a job with her. there is a water leak so they have to keep the water cut off until they need it on. the electricity only works in one bedroom so they cannot run AC or the fridge or cook and when they need to use the water, there’s no hot water because the water heater can’t get power. (it is rural mississippi in the middle of summer) but she chose to move there.

i have a decent job and i move in with my dad tomorrow. my plan is to save up enough money to pay off debts and to buy a car for her with cash and for a down payment on a house i can own. i have been renting different houses for almost 4 years and i’m throwing money away

she wants me to just go rent another house so we can be together just us two. i told her i want to own my next home and she is saying i don’t care about her living situation. i’ve offered solutions like living with other people and for me to pay to have someone fix the issues with her mom’s trailer

she is genuinely mad at me for not getting her out of that trailer when i am trying to build a good future for us both. she threatened to kill herself to see if i would just go ahead and get us a place. i think the whole situation is crazy. Save up and take care of yourself first. She's gotta grow up and get it together instead of trying to live off of you. You offered to help and that's all you should be offering. Don't let her emotionally manipulate you with the threats of taking her life. Let her be mad. If she continues on with her mess instead of helping herself then you probably should dump her.

"I've been on and off with guy for two years. We both know we still have feelings for each other but there's just a lot of baggage that makes us not be together. But recently we had like an actual cut off where we didn't talk to each other for a month. I may have told him that we should both see other people and see how it feels and that really hurt him because he felt like I was using him like a second option. I mean he's not wrong because the two years I got no interest from him and all of a sudden he's like trying to peruse me I needed to see if I still, felt for him. I ended up sleeping with someone random off hinge and this is something I've never done. It was strictly sex that was kinda bad. I felt like I had to sleep with someone to move on but clear I couldn't. But anyways I'm talking to the original guy now and I told him I slept with someone. He's kinda mad at me and doesn't know how he feels. I feel like I fucked up, I regret sleeping with the random guy already but telling him about it makes me regret it more.

"This incident just happened and I feel like I’m losing my mind. My husband (28M) and I (27F) were having a conversation this morning about getting our house cleaned up and organized. He swears I didn’t say something to him but I know I definitely did. Neither of us were on our phones while this was happening. We were sitting on my ILs front porch drinking coffee. The conversation went something like this: 

Me: you know the accent wall in our kitchen that is a greenish color? 

Him: yeah 

Me: I want to get something like a hutch to put there so we can actually store things in drawers. I also want to get something with drawers to go in the living room. 

Him: yeah I think that would be good 

Then we moved on talking about other stuff. So about an hour ago we were talking to his parents about it and I mentioned it again and he had no clue what I was talking about. I went through the whole conversation again and he swears I didn’t say that. 

This happens once a week (or less) for us. It drives me insane. I know 100% I said what I did. He does have ADHD (I do too but I have inattentive ADHD) so I’m sure it’s something related to that. 

I’m really not mad about the fact that he didn’t hear me. I’m mad that he tells me I didn’t say something when I know for sure I did. Does anyone else have this problem? Should I just start recording our conversations so I can play it back for him later? Does anyone have any advice on how to fix this?  I think one record and playback would/should be enough to permanently stop the feeling like you're losing your mind part. [Practical Advice]"
"I (F 22)have been with my partner (M 22)for almost 4 years now. Generally we are really happy and have overcome a lot of difficult barriers to get to where we are today. However we have recently realised that our life goals do not align with each other. 
My partner works really hard as he has to financially support his family (him being the main provider) which means he normally works all day. Because of this I only ever see him once a week and really also only call once or twice a week. While I would like more I've accepted that this is his schedule. He also always goes away on work trips for weeks on end which I've had to get used to. It's especially tough right now because I want a lot more out of the relationship than I get but I can understand that he needs to work this hard and he does have these great career opportunities that I would never want to hold him back on. 
But the main issue is that he wants to keep working this hard, even harder, partly to support his future and his family, but also partly because it's his career goal to become extremely successful with his own company and retire early when he can finally relax. As hard as it is not being with him much I want to support his career journey, but I also do feel like by the time we aim to get married, I want him to settle down, work more normal hours and just be able to actually spend evenings with him literally just doing things like cooking dinner together or having games nights. But with his career goals this is unlikely as he probably won't be able to reach this stage until mid/late 30s. I know that that is his dream, but I also don't want to be alone in the marriage. I know he says he'll try his best to give me time but realistically with what I'm experiencing now in the relationship I don't think is realistic.
I just wanted to write this to explain my thoughts and see if anyone who's gone through similar situations has any advice on what to do. I don't want to break up with him as he is a big part of my life but I worry I am going to end up resenting him by not prioritizing time with me. I can't tell if I need to let go more and be more supportive or if what I'm asking is reasonable. Do you have a better option? [Not Relevant]"
"Context: Girlfriend and I are both attending the same school where we met at the start of last quarter. We have been together about 4 months. Over the summer, I left to go back home, and she stayed up at school, which is about 3 hours from me. Before I left, we agreed to stay exclusive to one and other, while also agreeing to visit one and other as often as possible. 


My (20M)Girlfriend (20F) called me yesterday and asked if we could go on a no-contact no-commitment break over the summer because she has too much going on with work and other personal things.  This seemed very out of the blue, and I wasn’t very interested in having much of a conversation about it because I was so caught off guard. I texted her afterwards apologizing for my lack of communication, and asked if we could have another conversation about it. I am fine with going on a break if that’s what she needs, but I am not okay with both of us seeing other people for two months, and then getting back together in the fall like it didn’t happen. 


Would it be unreasonable of me to request that we remain committed to eachother despite being on a break? 


Any other advice/opinions on the matter are also appreciated, i’m feeling a bit lost. I like this girl a lot, and I want this to last. 
 Break up and move on. 

She won't respect the exclusivity deal anyway [Practical Advice]"
"Hi,

My Girlfriend was just told by her friend’s boyfriend that he is proposing in a few weeks. We currently have a trip from Denver - Chicago (July 6th weekend, my family wedding) a trip from Denver - Philly (July 13th weekend, to visit GF friends) a trip from Denver - St Louis (July 27th, golf trip without her) and a trip from Denver - Vegas (August 3rd weekend, our friends Bday).

As you see the only weekend that is open for the next 5 weekends is now the weekend her friend is getting proposed to. I am friends with these two people but not nearly as close as my GF is. I feel like this is a situation where she should be going by herself as she wants to go & and I should not feel guilty for not going. She says “If it’s somewhere you would want me to go, I would go” and it makes me feel guilty. I feel like a bad BF if I do not go, but I truly do not want to with all these other weekends traveling. What is the healthy way to deal with this situation?

 Just communicate. Let her know you do care about her, but you're traveling SO much more than usual during this period that you just need a break. Her wants and needs aren't the only ones that matter in your relationship, and there needs to be some give and take. If she can't accept that, then it's something the two of you need to discuss about compatibility in your relationship in general. Needing one weekend of five to unwind and relax at home is a perfectly normal and healthy request. That doesn't mean she has to stay home too, but you don't have to be joined at the hip at all times when your wants and needs differ occasionally. [Practical Advice]"
"I have been with my boyfriend for a year. My father is a pastor and he can hear from God. When my dad first met my boyfriend, he said that God told him that I needed to leave him alone because he would be dangerous and hurt me. Although my boyfriend is much taller than me and bigger than me, he has NEVER shown any signs of being hurtful and has never put me in danger, much in fact that he is very hesitant about being physically close to me because of the fear of hurting me. My boyfriend has also been very supportive while I'm in school, offering to help me pay for books, getting me better food, and driving over three hours just to visit me on the weekends. I went to see my boyfriend yesterday and my father says that God will severely punish me for not listening.

I don't want to disobey God but my boyfriend is the total opposite of how my father describes him. I don't want to leave and hurt my boyfriend for this, as my boyfriend has had a not so good life and believes that God dislikes him. I am struggling with my head and my heart. I don't want to lose my boyfriend but I also don't want to disobey God longer. Part of me feels that God will bring my boyfriend back into my life if I let him go but I am not certain about it, which further scares me.

Any advice would help a lot. Thank you Ask yourself, between your boyfriend and God, who drove three hours to visit you?  Did God or your boyfriend shell out for books?  It sounds like you possibly have a very nice boyfriend, but your upbringing (and a manipulative father) is making you question the facts before your eyes.

Honestly, you are 19, you have a plenty of time to sort through your feelings and figure out what is best for you. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I got out of a long term relationship with a highschool partner several months ago. I've been hitting it off with a guy I met on a dating app but I never know what to suggest for dates even though I really want to spend more time with him. My go to is usually billiards because I like to play a game while talking- it takes a lot of pressure off me. He's not a fan though. We've gone for food and for walks around the city or at parks. I want to change things up a bit though. I'm out of ideas because he's not super into ""slower"" game dates such as 2 player board/card games. The date idea does not need to involve a game though. Go to some cultural events, like an art exhibition or some shit. So you could talk to him while pretending to like crappy painting and look cultured. A lot of peoples do that... [Practical Advice]"
"I (30F) have been on 2 dates with a guy (32M)  who has an eyebrow piercing. We met on a dating app & the piercing is not visible in any of the pics on his profile (it may be new).

I’m really not into piercings on men & do not match with guys who have them. When he showed up with one on our first date, I immediately thought this was a no but continued the date to not be rude. 

Anyways, we’ve really hit it off and have had 2 6+ hour dates. However, I still can’t see myself dating a guy with a piercing long term (every time I notice it I get an ick). 

Should I just cut things off now since it’s so early or should I continue & maybe ask if he’d be open to removing it if we ever get to the relationship phase? If I cut things off, do I mention the piercing as a reason? If I continue & then ask about him removing it as we start to get more serious, when is the right time to do that?

I’ve never asked a partner to change anything about their appearance and don’t really feel that it’s fair, but this feels more fixable than most things which is why I’m wondering if talking about it makes sense. 

TLDR: Newly dating a man with a piercing (dealbreaker for me). Break things off or ask if he’d be open to removing it?

Edit: Thank you all for the advice! I’ve decided to just break things off with him. I think you all are right that if I was super into him it wouldn’t be an issue. And he deserves someone who is super into him just the way he is Break it off. He isn't your type. You can't ask someone (especially who you just met) to change their appearance or themselves. Lol or ask and see if he just leaves you first. [Practical Advice]"
"Anytime there's a minor inconvenience in his life, he tends to cope through food. It annoys me and it worries me. He has several lifestyle related health issues like diabetes, cholesterol and high BP. He usually binges on fried junk food. He also has a soft spot for rice and eats a lot of it. Most of his meals are very rice heavy which is not got for disbetes. 
We don't have healthy communication in the family. I believe he has several unresolved issues but he refuses to go for therapy. He generally gets very defensive when anyone points out any flaw of his. How can I bring up delicately and respectfully?  I know this isn't the answer u want but I'm not really sure what u can do. You can try talking to him and telling him your concerns but he's an adult whose going to do what he's going to do. [Practical Advice]"
"My bf and I have been together for almost a year. We’ve had our communication-spats, but we’ve been so into each other that we’ve worked through them. For the most part. 
We have one difference that honestly shouldn’t be that big of a deal, but it’s become one of our biggest hurdles. 
We don’t live together yet. And naturally a lot of sleepovers happen. 90% of the time it runs smoothly. The last 10% though…
I’m a bit of a rule-follower. I like structure. So when we agree to do sleepovers, I go very far to keep those plans intact. Because we made plans together. He, however, is a little more laid back. Those 10% of the time- he cancels. And I don’t mean a day or so in advance. He’ll sometimes cancel 20 minutes after we agreed to meet. He tries to make new plans immediately, but I get mad, of course.
I tried to talk to him about it, and said it made me super uncomfortable, that he couldn’t at least cancel some time ahead. It’s stressful and makes me feel insecure.
He says that usually it happens because he is way too tired and don’t want to disappoint me because he won’t be able to be that present in our time spend together. And that he values relations where we can say no, when one of us isn’t up for meeting.
It hurt me when he said it like that. Because of course I want him to be able to cancel if he’s not up for meeting. But I’m not okay with getting all excited to see him to then be disappointed at the last minute. 
With the way he said this, I’m not sure I’m being too demanding. Any one have any experience similar to this? Thanks in advance. Unless there was some kind of plan with unrefundable tickets or reservations, I honestly don’t understand why you’d be so upset about canceling a hangout where there was nothing planned. Especially when it’s not happening frequently.

Self care is important and if he’s tired and just wants to stay home, that makes sense to me. 🤷‍♀️

How often are these sleepovers? How far of a drive is it? What are the expectations when you have one? 

I dunno, when I (45F) was dating my partner and we didn’t live together, we usually got together 1-2 times a week and they were always sleepovers and usually at his house which was a 30 min drive for me. Sometimes after a long day at work with an early morning start, I just didn’t feel like it. Not that I didn’t want to see him but I needed the rest more. [Commentator's opinion]"
"Sorry in advance if this is all over the place. Also when I mention summer its when school ended for my son. (If that makes sense lol) 

My husband and I have been married for 8 years. So I have been to quite a lot of his family events and his to mine. For the past 3 years in the summer,  because we live about 2 hours away from family.  I would take the children to his family events while he works as well as mine. I am also a stay at home mom , so regardless the children are always with me. 

This week I just took our children to his older sisters house for a pool party, and she invited us back for a 4th of July party. All of which my husband was working or will be working. Ive known his family for so long, if Im not tired I go because I enjoy hanging out with them too. 

This summer his youngest brother(29M) is having a birthday party along with his son(9m) and he invited us. I told him I am all partied out can he take the children this time by his self. 

His first response is to say, ""You see, this is why I don't invite you to go places with me. Whenever I want you to go to my family with me , its a no."" 

This summer alone, we have been to both his niece and nephew graduations together. I have been to two of his sisters pool parties and the summer just began. 

After arguing, I feel for no reason. The point he was trying to make is this brother that invited us usually doesn't throw parties and it could be a time for ""us"" to hang out. 

My point is , realistically he is going to leave us by going for a ""walk""(if you know you know) as he always do and I won't probably see him again until its time to clean up( because he loves to stay and clean). So the whole time I will have to keep an eye on my children and one of them is a toddler, so I will be with a child all night. 

Which brought me back to my first response of ""Can you take them instead?"".

I feel like he is trying to guilt trip me into going. I think you make a deal with him .... You go this time, but you are going to pass on a couple of upcoming events. And, if he goes for a walk (no, I don't know, but I assume it's to smoke pot) and you don't see him again until the end, he loses the right to complain if you decide not to go in the future. 

If you don't like that idea, maybe ask him if he intends to watch the children so you can have fun, too. [Practical Advice]"
"My partner was logged into his “work” instagram and got a message from a new coworker saying “hope to see you are the office”. He said the same back and then added “dig your vibe :)” and then deleted the entire conversation between the two of them. He does not delete other conversations. 

I am upset feeling like there were flirty undertones and ulterior motives and that he deleted the messages for a reason- because they weren’t appropriate. 

He claims he doesn’t have any interest and “thought she was a lesbian” so there was no issue with sending “dig your vibe :)” 

Is it overreacting to feel like this was dishonest and not trustworthy behavior, or was he being shady by being flirty and deleting it?

"Is it a dick move? Did I do something here that stands out? I'm trying to let this guy know that yea, I am indeed upset and and he fucked up.

We go to the same gym, it's a 24/hour place but haven't ever crossed each other until now. Right before this just happened, we argued and officially broked it off by me telling him he's 1. On my shit list and 2. Fuck him.

I saw his truck in the parking lot when I was at the gym, so I put his stuffed animal he gave me (which just so happened to be in my car) on his truck bed. 

Would he care? Is this a shitty thing to do to someone? If I'm being fr, I don't want to break it off. I just wanted to be treated differently I guess. Idk 

I broke it off because I've been doing everything for him. I drive out to him (15-20 min drive) and always am paying, always going the 3xtra mile etc. Idc much about the money, but I make incomparably less than he does. But he does nothing for me, and doesn't realize this. I paid for a trip to Vegas (week) and pay for dinner etc etc. Truly, though, I don't care that much about the paying for things. It's that I'm not being used it what it feels like. We actually broke it off a while ago and we're in this weird friendship thing... but he continually asked for sex even though I told him no, and how it made me feel used. So yea I just told him to fuck off and gave his thing back. Idk what do yall think? 1. Do whatever makes you feel best. If getting rid of a gift makes you feel better, do that. If keeping it makes you feel better, do that. 

But don’t base your decision with the hope of making *him* feel something. Because.. 

2. No, people in situationships generally don’t care if you give a gift back or not. If your decisions had any effect on them, they wouldn’t have treated you so carelessly in the first place. They didn’t care when you were seeing each other. They don’t care now. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I [38] have a female friend [36] who I've been developing feelings for the last few months. I seriously thought she was too, especially a few weeks ago when we were hanging out and she started being very physical affectionate in a way she hasn't ever been before - she sneaked up and kissed me on the cheek when we met, cuddled up very closely and intimately with me while we were laying in the park, held hands with me as we walked, and encouraged me to cuddle her some more when we stopped walking to admire a view.

I had thought that was going great, but then she very suddenly stopped and went cold,  and when I told her next day about my feelings she said she didn't feel the same. She said her affection was only platonic and she was irritated that I'd 'misinterpreted' it. I was pretty hurt and confused,  and said I wanted to talk more about where we stand going forward. She said she was stressed and needed a few days to process things. 

That was a month ago, and she's been silent since. We used to message multiple times every day, but she stopped completely, other than a brief spurt of messaging a couple weeks ago as if everything was normal, which stopped again as suddenly as it started.

I was planning on cutting her off completely,  but then all of a sudden, early this morning, she messaged again. She sent me a link to an upbeat song about love in one of her spotify playlists, saying it was to give me energy for the week.

Should I even bother responding? Should I mention the silence, or previous events? Really not sure what to do here. Hmm maybe she's an emotionally avoidant person, who's afraid of showing and responding to affection. She do like u and the day u went to hang out in the park her harmonies conquered her fear but when she got ur messages and didn't know how to react so she chose the worst way---rej and pretend to be cool. IDK this is a toxic assumption. [Commentator's opinion]"
"Hey everyone! I just recently joined dating apps and have talked to three guys seriously so far. The first two were nice and we went on dates and it was good but with the third guy we’ve only texted so far but it feels different somehow, like this is how it’s supposed to feel. We haven’t even been in our date yet (which is tomorrow) and I feel like I’m already head over heels. Is this a bad things? I’m not gonna tell him “I love you” super early or rush to make it official but I think we both fall quickly and fall hard so I’m worried for some reason? We’ve talked about it just a little and said that these feelings of attachment usually last beyond a “honeymoon” phase so I’m hoping that isn’t an issue but something still feels too good to be true. 
Is it bad we’re both so into each other already? We haven’t talked about anything crazy like marriage or kids but we’ve talked for hours every day and are pretty flirty (calling each orher cute, adorable, etc.) even though it’s only been a few days. Should I even be worried about this?
I’m hoping the date goes well tomorrow and that the chemistry over the phone translates in person. 
Is there anything I should watch out for or be cautious of?
Any thoughts are appreciated!!! People can be very different in person.

Just approach your date with an open mind. If it feels more awkward than over the phone, that might not necessarily be a sign that you’re not well suited for each other.  [Practical Advice]"

Reason being, I don’t see myself going out for water or juice/mocktails and I don’t drink alcohol or coffee…plus the drinks are the most expensive things on the menu. Why go on a drinks date if you’re not drinking?

"Okay, so I (27M) have a thing for my girlfriend's feet (27F). I mean, I just find them beautiful and interesting, but I feel ashamed of that because when we discussed some kinks, she told me that people who like feet gross her out . And I'm going to be honest, okay? I'm not a full-on feet guy; I just like hers, and I don't know why. I don't want to go into details.

Anyway, I've kept that inside myself for 6 whole years. By the way, everything is great here. We have a healthy relationship and a healthy sex life, but I feel an urge to tell her about my ""kink."" However, I'm still afraid (foolish, yes, after 6 years), and I don't know what to do, so I came here for advice.

What do you think I should do? How should I approach this...

Edit - also sorry for my english. If you’re having this much shame telling your gf about her feet obviously it’s probably a little more explicit than you let on.

"Me (23F) and my ex (32M) met on dating app. I've just got out of a 3-year relationship 3 months ago. Although I hate to admit, my initial intentions to download the dating app was to have some fun. Then I matched with this guy, which is my ex. He said that he wanted to date to marry. He seemed super sincere, after matching with me and asking for a chance to get to know each other, he removed all of the previous matches. He took me on our 1st date, he was humble, kind and truthful, the way he talk about himself, his family, and his career made me believe that he was the best green flag I had ever met. I was treated like a princess, and then he asked me to be his girlfriend. After the date, we got closer, we talked about daily life things and also mentioned about intimacy. On our 2nd date, we both agreed to have sex for the first time. Everything was great. From that day on, he did text me like usual, but the amount of messages decreased, he also complained with me that he had a lot of work to do (he is a civil engineer), it took him some hours to reply messages lol, sometimes even fell asleep while texting 😂 I realized that I had developed feelings for him, but couldn't get the same attention from him, I knew I messed it up this time 😂. I decided to stop this relationship before it's too late. I texted him to explain that I wanted to stop because the lack of time we had for each other, and he said that he was in shock, but still respect my opinion.
Have you ever been through the same situation? I want to hear from you. Even though you both agreed, the toxic mindset that men have is that if she did it with that quick then she did it with everybody. Basically you’re easy. 
This is why I believe if you’re ever going to have sex with a guy thats not your partner, you have to be okay with the possibility of him ghosting you the next day. So what it comes down to make sure you really want just sex. 

I had guys use me for sex and try to play me. When you get older and date more you catch on and realize waiting is worth it. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I (25f) have been talking to this guy (27m) for a few weeks now and the situation is straight up something I can’t believe is happening to me.

We met on a dating app. When I first saw his profile, I was like this guy is a model it has to be someone catfishing with his pics. He’s as tall, dark, and handsome as it gets. I told myself what the hell and took the chance to match with him anyway. We end up on FaceTime and I’m like holyyy shiiii he’s real.

We keep talking and add each other on social media. He has thousands of followers. He’s a soon to be doctor, a former professional athlete, and has a ton of friends. I on the other hand have less than 200 followers, hardly post, and a very small social circle. He’s always out and I’m a homebody.

We’ve gone on a few dates now and he’s still showing so much interest. He’s been nothing but sweet, kind, and respectful. Always texting me, calling, planning dates, and respecting my boundaries around intimacy.

I really like his personality too. I thought I wouldn’t because I despise all social media and he has quite a social media image, but he’s so much more deep than what his pictures portray.

I never once mentioned this to him, but I have no idea why he’s supposedly so interested in me. I’m objectively not as attractive or social as him. I’d say I’m cute, have a pretty fit body, and also a doctor, but it’s nothing compared to the girls following him. I know people stare at us when we walk down the street together. They probably thinking wtf why is someone so hot with her???

I see myself sabotaging this in the future. I never once mentioned how I feel or ask why me. But it just feels too good to be true to me. Do I talk to him about the obvious? I’ve seen a ton of happy couples in a similar situation like yours. Chill out and don’t sabotage yourself. Also don’t tell him this stuff! You are doing great [Practical Advice]"
"I came out of a LTR about 2-3 months ago and recently started dating again.

I met someone on Bumble and we went out on a date which turned into spending the day together. By the end of the day I'd seen some behaviors which I wouldn't want in a new LTR and so very transparently and nicely said I don't think I'd want a LTR however am happy to be friends / casually date.

We went out on a second date and I noticed her saying something like ""you won't find someone as cool as me or as fun as me / another me"" and recently she sent a meme to me which says ""Sorry for being so beautiful, fun and intelligent"" with like hearts and a unicorn in the background.

She's a bit eccentric which is cool but I'm really not sure what's going on with this theme of talking about herself and praising herself and I don't know what to say / do when she says / sends these things. It's a bit concerning.

Aside from this theme, she's pretty nice and cool to be around. And said on the first that that she would also like to keep things casual. That said, how do I navigate these kinds of messages? The initial situation is very weird. Your first date went so well that it lasted a whole day? That is some real good chemistry and very discordant with your statement this isn't going to last long term. You sent some very mixed signals. I can't say I blame them for trying to change your mind. After the ""kind offer"" by you to date casually? That might be very frank and practical, but could also be taken as a jerk statement. For a man to say some variation of, ""We can hang and fuck if you want to, but so you know, we aren't going to be together for ever."" shows a lot more big D energy and han I've ever had. Maybe I am just jealous, but comes of as an ass to me.

And I wish people would give up on finding friends on dating apps. You can be friends with a ex. You can't be friends with some one you met explicitly to date. These real weak have it anyway you want it stances are taken as mixed messaging at best, or worst given how much time you've wasted of someone else [Commentator's opinion]"

"I (christian) have been in relationship for 26 months with my boyfriend (Muslim). The religion has not been a big problem for us until recently, during the past Ramadan my boyfriend complained of feeling lonely.

We would go to the mosque together for Taraweeh, but I would remain in the car because I am a christian. He said felt lonely and craved the companionship of praying together and being in unison with each other's beliefs.

He also said we should break up because I want to gain financial stability before settling down and he wants to settle down now, and we already decided that once settled down, we would take on traditional roles (stay at home wife, working husband) which I really don't have a problem with.

I have begged him so many times that we shoukd go ahead and be together because I feel like there's no compromise I wouldn't make to be with him but he said it's unfair to me. 
I asked him to wait for 18 months so that I can gain financial stability but he said it feels unfair to him.

I really do not want to lose my man because he is my everything and I am more than content with him

I recently said somethings that made him mad at me and he isn't talking to me now i am really hurting because I miss him and I don't want to feel abandoned again Many many red flags.  You are way too different.  It was fun for a time, now it’s time to move on.  1. Not aligned on finances. 2. Not aligned on religion. 3. One person rushing to lock the other down.

"I have done a bit of thinking and have somewhat formulated my opinion but I figure I should get some other thoughts before I make a decision.

So I met this girl who's 19. She is super nice and we sorta became friends. I thought it was platonic and had zero intentions of changing that just because I thought our age and careers were at different points. I get along really well with her and even remember I wished I could meet a girl like her but I again did not intend on asking her out. Looking back there was maybe signs she liked me (compliments, friendly and talkative with me) but I thought that was just who she was. Anyways, she asked for my number and we've been been talking alot lately. She is a sweetheart of a person.

My problem is I feel so much older than her especially at this age range. If she were 30 and I were 37 I wouldn't really think twice. But 19 is just so young. I feel like a cradle robber even though she asked me and I haven't initiated anything yet.

Relationship wise we are maybe closer in years. I've been single a long time and haven't dated just because I've been focusing on my personal and professional life. I honestly think she has more relationship experience than I do. I would say she is mature for her age but god that just sounds like creepy justification.

I like the girl, and we get along. I just feel like I'm taking advantage of someone who is too young (and I haven't even done anything but talk with her!). At this point I'm leaning to somehow terminating whatever is happening. Before I do I want to see if any of you think I'm doing this prematurely. Should I let it play out a bit longer and see if it fizzles on its own? Assuming the consensus is to end it do you all have any idea how to let her down gently? She's a super nice person and it was ballsy of her to ask for my number so I don't want to hurt her and like I said I really don't have much experience in the relationship realm.

Thanks You're too old for her. She still has a lot of growing up to do. Let her enjoy being young with people her own age. If you step in and start a serious relationship, she's going to have to grow up too fast to catch up to you. Or you're going to be annoyed when she's still doing teenie-bopper shit and making poor decisions (which she will do because her brain won't finish developing until her mid-20s).

Go find someone your own age. [Practical Advice]"
"I'm 37 and she's 35, together for a bit over 2 years, living together. Recently she was showing me something on instagram that someone DMed her. While looking for it in her messages, I noticed a name of a guy I haven't heard about. Asked who that was and she said it's her colleague from work. She said they just send each other some funny reels from time to time. She opened the chat with him and quickly scrolled through to show me. While doing that I noticed some text exchange and asked if she can pause. She did and what I saw really surprised me - the guy said they should go for a beer/whisky (her drink of choice) catch up - to which she responded that it's necessary and she will let him know.

She claims that she didn't have an intention of going out with him (and didn't go nor made any plans) but she didn't know how to respond. Also states that the guy is older and has a wife and kids. She also mentioned that they went out a few times with her two other girlfriends from work and him. She says that this guy didn't have any other intentions than just to catch up.

While I want to believe what she is saying, it also doesn't feel entirely right. Any tips how I should interpret and handle this situation?

Thanks! Really depends on context.

Worse case scenario, she's a cheater that likes cheap attention and it's better you found out early.

Best case scenario, she's a helluva great girlfriend that is trustworthy and upfront with you seeing as how she treated the other guy like any other female coworker.

I myself, as a straight male, always forget that some people read too much into things and I've a bad habit of seeing if a friend wants to ""go out for drinks"" and yes, I know their drink of choice just because I'm a good friend.

Chances are its the latter. [Commentator's opinion]"
"Hello everyone,

It seems like my relationship is going downhill. My girlfriend is almost never happy with me and gets mad at everything I do. For example, we went to a festival last night (even though I hate festivals and she knows that but I went for her because I knew it would make her happy) and this morning she was telling me how we should have danced more, how we should have done more things and stuff - even though from my point of view things were going well and we were actually having fun. I feel like she always sees the bad part of things while I try to be more optimistic.

Another issue is our sex life. Although it has never been the best, a few years ago we used to do it regularly (twice a month or so). But this year we haven't done it even once. And I don't necessarily have a problem with that, but she also got mad at me for a few days when she found out I was watching porn. She used to send me nudes and I didn't need porn, but these days she doesn't send me those either. And I am tired of asking her to have sex or send me nudes because it feels like she always finds excuses not to come  at my place or send me things. And because I don't want to pressure her in any way, I resort to watching porn to relieve some stress. 

Also, I feel like she gets mad at almost every little thing I do that she doesn't agree with. In the last few months I've had a lot of stress regarding my career and I've told her that sometimes I might not be 100% when we go out, for example. Even though I tell her that, she always gets mad at me when we're in a restaurant and I look around, saying that I'm not paying enough attention to our relationship and to what she's saying. 

She seems to get mad when I go out with my friends too (although I am doing that only once a month usually). Last week I asked her if she wants to go out with me and she said ""no"", because she had some exams. I fully understood that, and some friends asked me to go out with them that day and I accepted. She got mad because I did that, I am still not sure why... I go out with her 10x more than I go with my friends and I always put here on the first place when it comes to these things, but I still fell that this isn't enough.

Should I break up with her? Or try to restore the relationship? Because after 4 years being together, it feels so hard just to let anything behind and start again... Yes, if the two of you are not happy,  you should break up. People often stay in an unhappy relationship because it’s become comfortable or they fear being alone . You both deserve to be with someone who makes you happy. Say, “It doesn’t seem as if we make each other happy and , I don’t see this relationship going any farther. I think it would be best if we went our separate ways.“ It’s unnecessary to go into details because that will likely just evolve into a fight over who’s right/wrong. If you are living together, make sure you have an exit strategy. [Practical Advice]"
"My wife and I recently had a son in January, she quit her job a few months before the baby was born and I've been supporting us financially for the past 9 months or so. Quickly after the baby's birth we accumulated and have been bouncing between 500-1000 dollars in credit card debt which I've desperately been trying to pay off, medical bills from a hospital stay she had 1 month after giving birth, and big bills such as new tires and registration for two cars, and house maintenance looming on the horizon.

My birthday is right around Christmas, being that my wife was 8 months pregnant and newly becoming the sole earner in my family I did not expect any big gifts. Both my birthday and Christmas came and went and my wife didn't even do so much as make a handwritten card to give me, I literally received nothing. I let her know I was upset that I didn't receive even a card and through several different discussions and arguments I believed we had worked out our issues. I just recently purchased myself a father's day gift knowing if I want more than a card that I'd have to get it for myself, which is perfectly fine with me. I knew from the start there would be lots of added stress and I would have to make sacrifices to start a family. 

however, last night my wife said her friends are coming into town in August and she wants to get a couple tattoos with them while they are here. Being that just about every cent I make goes to bills and groceries I asked how shed pay for it and she told me she's got a secret stash of money that shed use. I shrugged it off and said okay, because it is her money. But as the hours have passed it's starting to bug me more and more.

 Shes had to of had this money hidden since before she quit her job before December, and I got nothing from her during the holidays and she led me to believe that she had no money to buy gifts with, and she's watched me struggle and fall further and further behind on our bills for the past 6 months. 

Am I wrong for feeling like me and our family are not priority's for her? And if so how do I confront her about this situation? I don’t beleive you are wrong for feeling this way at alllllll. I would personally be very upset if I heard abt a secret stash of money, mind you it’s her $$, but why wouldn’t she want to get you something ? It could have been as little as your favorite candy. I would understand that she just had a baby, and she may be going through her own personal crisis… sometimes tattoos are an indicator of that. But I would talk to her abt the situation and ask her why wouldn’t you want to help your own family. Tattoos are something when you have everything paid and your family isn’t struggling.

If she doesn’t respond to talking, you could mention that the bills arent going to get paid and maybe it will wake her up a little? 
Or maybe start putting some of your own funds away, without her knowing so you can do something nice for yourself when she doesn’t feel like doing anything for you. 

Wish I could offer more help… but your feelings are completely valid. [Practical Advice]"
"I (25m) keeps getting unwanted attention from gay men. which I guess I appreciate because atleast there's people who find me attractive but it's kind of frustrating, I work out dress nice and I'm 6'5. All that for women but none would even look at me. There would be a point where these gay men would sexually harassed me in clubs or take advantage of me. It's disgusting to say the least.

"I (28 F) matched with a guy (31 M) on a dating app, and conversation has gone well. It's the most I've engaged with someone for a while. He asked for my phone number and I said no. He said he understood. I explained without too much detail that I got out of an abusive relationship a few years ago and had some stalking issues there still so I'm cautious and don't give out too much info too soon. His response was, ""You have a stalker? That must be flattering. Hahaha jk."" I responded saying ""no it's not, it was actually all really hard."" And then he apologized for making a joke of it and said it wasn't ""cool"" of him. 

Fairly, it rubbed me the wrong way. Tone deaf response, definitely. I just want to stop the conversation. But am I being unfair? I know people act dumb sometimes when someone shares something and they don't know how to respond. Or is this a clear sign that there's not going to be any empathy there?  If it made you uncomfortable and you want to end the conversation, that's valid. Your boundaries are your boundaries.

If you're not sure, you could always take a few days off the app to think it over and decide if his apology feels genuine. If you decide to continue getting to know him, now that he knows it is a boundary, if he crosses the line there's no mistaking it for nerves or a misguided attempt to be witty or perhaps lighten the mood on an app.

I'm sorry you went through all of that, I know from experience it's hard to start trusting again on the other side. [Practical Advice]"
"Two weeks ago i met this lovely lady on a Muslim dating app. We got along very good, same interests. We both are from Turkey living in Germany. The only problem is, she lives 500km away. But this past weekend she was on a wedding of her friends‘ which was 1 hour from me. We decided to meet on Sunday (yesterday) but she told me couple of days before that sunday won‘t work. So when she was at the wedding i jokingly asked her that we can meet up after the wedding (jokingly because the wedding would end at night). And then she said at 2 at night that we can meet now. Idk what got me but i jumped from my bed and drove off after that. 1 hour car ride and i was at her hotel at 3 at night. We talked a lot, got ice cream at McDonalds (she even offered to pay). And at 4:30 i drove home and she went to sleep at her hotel. But i was really surprised when i saw a text from her when i got home if i arrived. She really waited one hour til i got home. These past two days i am thinking about her all day. My car even smells like her. 🫠 So what do you think? Should i tell her that i have a crush on her or is it too soon and i‘d scare her away?

"Met someone wonderful on Hinge a few weeks ago on vacation. We live on opposite coasts in the states but want to try to make it work! He (35M) is visiting me (30F) for the first time in my city and I am extremely excited but also slightly apprehensive about him staying with me for three days. Is it too soon? We’re not officially dating yet just talking still and seeing where this goes. Him staying with me feels like a very big step but is it on par with him visiting me and I should be more vulnerable? How do I go about asking him to get his own hotel room? Should I offer to get one for him?

One of my friends thinks my asking him to stay elsewhere even thought he’s coming specifically to see me and spend all weekend with me will send the wrong message about me and my intentions with him. The next step if this goes well would be visiting him. 

It’s early but I feel really good about him/this and want to proceed with intention and he seems to be in the same boat. Any advice would be much appreciated!

"Context: I met this guy on work. Sometimes I would catch him looking at me then turning away suddenly whenever I would look at him. He would come to the place that I work at ( he works at another department ) multiple times a day, would ask what my name is, and while I was preparing his order for him, I could notice him staring at me. This goes on for about a month. Strange thing is, whenever I look at him, he snatches his gaze away. His manager once told me in front of him and that he is “good with girls”. Anyways, fast forward, I start liking him too, I tell my supervisor about it and she thinks it’s a good idea to be a matchmaker for us. Spoiler: she makes it too obvious that I like him and I think okay, this is over for me, he’s gonna lose interest. Now he doesn’t initiate conversation, kind of turned abit ‘cold’. BUT he still keeps staring and glancing at me whenever he thinks I don’t notice. Even my coworker told me he saw him staring at me. What’s the explanation behind his behavior?

I immediately had a pretty visceral reaction: ""what the fuck"" ""fuck you"" ""where did that come from"" ""what compells you to say sometbing like that"" etc. but took myself aside for a second to cool off. He knows I've had some marginal experiences and that would be a particularly sensitive topic for me. It was so fucking out of pocket and out of character. His explanation was that it was dark humour and that him and his friends make jokes about dark things. I just could not believe my ears. I kept on being like how could you possibly think that was funny even in any context ever ?!?!?!  

Anyways. 

I now feel very conflicted on what sort of person he is. He's never said anything of this nature before and had always approached the topic of sexual assault very carefully or seemed to have concern at least. 

Pretty fucked up from my point of view and it really really really left just a terrible taste in my mouth. Am I overreacting? What would you do??!!

"I will try to keep this short. My boyfriend and I use third party social media to send impromptu private and risqué photos. We FaceTimed this morning as usual, and I could see that he was in the mood, and he asked for photo to help take care of him. I happily obliged and sent the photo. However, the aftermath of this is where I am stuck. After receiving the notification that he opened my photo, my BF was silent on the call and spoke only once to call me pretty. The next 5-7 minutes were silent and I had no clue what to do/say. Then, he enthusiastically says, “hey baby!”, and I ask him if he had done anything with my photo and he replied that he already saw it and finished to it. I was kind of in shock and even now I just don’t understand his thought process. I would’ve like to been included or even told about what he was doing, not just have it mentioned to me after the fact, especially since I was literally on the phone with him. I feel like it was common sense to follow through considering he initiated here and any other time we’ve done this both parties were active on the call. Was it a fluke? He said he doesn’t know why he did it and it had nothing to do with embarrassment or nervousness. Am I right to feel used/betrayed/hurt or am I totally blowing this out of proportion?

"So I feel like I could make this way to drawn out so I’ll try to make it as short as I can. So for the story I’ll just call her H. We all ended up going on this trip through our colleges. Just so happens H is going a the same school I’ll be going to in the fall. Since in total it’s around 50 people on this tour group us young ones stick together. “When in Rome” ig we’ve been getting drunk and staying up about every night. (A week) ik it sounds horrible saying it outloud. 

From all this me and her have grown real close (drinking buddies) definitely real good vibe to her like on homie status. She’s  told me about her life, trauma, her goals. And 2 a certain extent me too. Well speaking on trauma she’s only had 1 ex and he abused and cheated on her. Well just keep that in mind. 

Last night she ran out of zan and finished off her cart that she smuggled overseas. So she was going through withdrawal badddd. So when we were hanging out one on one the night before the whole withdrawal stuff it got real late into the night and she ended up low key kicking me out cuz she said she can’t sleep in the same room as a man not even her brother after her ex.

So last night while she was feeling so ruff our friend booked her a taxi back 2 the hotel and I went back with her to make sure she’s ok. I spent the whole ride with my arm around her cuz she asked. Well I ended up just laying beside here while she was dry heaving and I just felt so bad I couldn’t help her. Like all I wanted to do was help her at the very least just put my hand on her shoulder and comfort her but I basically ended up laying with her till she just told me she doesn’t wanna be touched and just wants to be alone rn.

So that was 2 days ago and we didn’t get much time to talk yesterday cuz we both just were feeling like ass her from withdrawal and me presumably from the bender we’ve both been on. 

All this boiling down to say do I just bit the bullet and tell her how I feel straight up or do I just keep quiet? We have 6 more days together and I’m just not trying to make it weird between us. 

(If this isn’t the right sub for things like this let me know a better one)  First off, this girl sounds like a lot of chaos, so I don't think it's a good idea to get with her. 


But if that's what you want to do, I recommend you SHOW not TELL.


Basically just kiss the girl next time you are in such a close, intimate situation. If you make a move and she turns away, that's rejection.

"
It kind of saddens me (F20) to know that so many people believe in the saying “once a cheater, always a cheater”. I cheated on my ex who held a knife to me and forced me to have sex and give BJs, and for some reason I always ran back to him between the ages of 15-18. I received therapy, but the name calling, harassment, and outcasting still haunts me from time to time. 

When I met my current bf (M21), I cheated and eventually broke up with my ex. It was the worst time of my life physically and emotionally, being the HS proclaimed whore. I lost all my friends, had no one besides him, and heavily self harmed from all the hateful emails and anonymous text messages sent from random people senior year.  He was there for me though it all and I am beyond grateful he showed me how beautiful life could be. I have zero desire for anyone besides him and our 2 year anniversary is coming up. 

I was recently told that odds are I’ll cheat again in the future and I understand that may be the case (statistically speaking) but I really love him and it hurts to hear that. I don’t think I’m a serial cheater, because it’s only happened once, but now I have this thought in my head that I’m going to ruin everything one day in the future and cheat when times get hard because of this one comment. How do I cope with this feeling and do you all believe in this saying? Hi OP! How does your bf feel about your past cheating (If he knows). Has it affected your sex life? I’m going through situationship with my bf right now. [Not Relevant]"

Instead he'd leave me on delivered even though he'd be active on insta for a good while 

When he does give me his time of day the conversation always leads from sweet talk to somehow being sexual so this is where I ask my question.

(I’m not scared that I’m actually pregnant as I was not even in my fertile window and my circle is pretty accurate and he did not c*m inside me but still I wanted to make the risk as little as possible)  Please use protection in the early stages of dating. Pregnancy and stds are not light matters. [Practical Advice]"
"I’ve (29m) have been talking with this girl (33f) and been on a few dates and she said she needs space to grieve and be in silence and with family. She’s a therapist and it’s been tough because she was just out of the country for 2 weeks and after 2 dates is leaving again now to attend that funeral and will be gone 10 days. Things are otherwise very fruitful, conversations have been getting much deeper and I’ve conveyed interest. She said she will message me when she returns. 

Is this a subtle avoidant way of saying she doesn’t want to move forward or wants to move on from me? 
 Or maybe she's just grieving and going through a tough time [Commentator's opinion]"
"Hi everyone,

Quick context:
We have been dating for a couple months now. This is my first real relationship, and have only been on a few dates with a girl before that. My girlfriend has had several relationships but none that lasted very long (a few months at most). My gf is also very comfortable with her guy friends and have slept in other friends beds’ a fair amount of times (before our relationship).

I need some advice on how to set boundaries with my girlfriend. Here’s a recent conversation we had that’s really confusing to me, and Im somewhat concerned about:

Around 3am she sent me a video of herself drunk, talking to me:
“I need to go to bed but you [unintelligible]. So we (her and her friend) sleep like [together] but I’m like [facing away].”

The conversation takes place the morning after.

She confirmed she was drunk and that she had slept at a friend’s house in Derry. Dylan (19M) is Canadian and only comes down for a couple of weeks each summer. She mentioned she slept in his bed and so did he.

I noticed from a Snap she sent that she was in a different bed frame and location, so I asked, “Whose bed is that lol?” She replied, “Dylan’s,” who she had previously talked about as being a friend she was excited to see. I then asked where Dylan slept, and she said, “In his bed.” I responded, “Like a heads-up would’ve been nice.”

Then she called me and said, “Hey, I thought you said you weren’t insecure,” referring to a recent time I said that I’m not an insecure person. I was so confused that I didn’t know what to say, and after expressing my confusion, she said, “I thought you would, okay have a good day, bye.” End of call.

She then texted me:
“He wasn’t even there the whole time.
He transferred to upstairs.
Deadass platonic sleepover.”

When texting, she mentioned the video she sent (which is very hard to understand) and said, “So like I did think of you last night, I also mentioned you. So like, fuck you.”

In the last phone call, she made it clear that she’s never been interested in him, there were two other girls on the pullout couch, and she wanted to drive home but they wouldn’t let her because she was too drunk (she’s told me other times where she has tried to drive when she’s drunk, but also had people stop her). She also said that Dylan was only there for 30 minutes before going back downstairs.

I want to stay together, but I feel like I need to  talk to her and maybe set some boundaries. How can I approach this situation without coming off as insecure or controlling?
 I was a wild child in my uni days. Was partying, was going to bars and slept in friends houses a lot. I have slept in beds with people I barely knew to sleep. BUT I never did that when I was in relationship, either found a way to go to my dorm/house or shared a bed with a female friend.

Her responses seems gaslight-ish and unnecessarily aggressive. It feels like she is trying to gaslight you into thinking that you are insecure and are reading too much into it. And also;

> so I asked, “Whose bed is that lol?” She replied, “Dylan’s,” who she had previously talked about as being a friend she was excited to see. I then asked where Dylan slept, and she said, “In his bed.”

>He wasn’t even there the whole time. He transferred to upstairs. Deadass platonic sleepover.”

>She also said that Dylan was only there for 30 minutes before going back downstairs.

Which one is true? Did he sleep in the bed, did he go upstairs, or did he go downstairs after 30 mins? These are 3 different stories...

This doesn't look good I'm sorry [Emotional Support]"
"My ex and I decided before our kid was born that we weren’t going to allow any pictures of her online. This came from our own wants of privacy as well as the protection of her from creeps online. Even while attending daycare we wouldn’t allow her to be included in anything public. 

We expressed this desire to all close to us soon after and everyone agreed to keep her offline. Aside from my sister accidentally posting a video on her story that was only up for a couple of minutes everyone respected our wishes. Aside from my mom. I don’t follow her on Instagram and I’m not on Facebook, so I don’t have access to her accounts. A couple of months after she was born I was on my mom’s phone and saw she had posted a picture of my newborn on instagram, showing her hands and feet. Not the biggest deal but I told her not to post anything else and that I wouldn’t be coming around otherwise. I don’t really see anything come up until earlier in the year where I see her Instagram open and it’s full of posts of her again. I told her again to stop but yet again I see her earlier today making a post on Instagram and again she seems to just ignore me. 

I’ve explained before why I do not want pictures online, including stories showing how it could get into the wrong hands. Her account is private but regardless I don’t want pictures online and I’ve been adamant on that stance since she’s been born. She disregards my wants and authority as the parent.  Me and my daughter are both living with her currently so I can’t exactly just remove visits. Is there a way to get her to stop posting and remove the pictures?   Report the pictures and her account over and over again on top of not giving her pictures and telling her she can't take pictures anymore, - now keep in mind she can always take them behind your back and still post them - I know crazy gmas that have done that there is nothing you can do really besides that nobody has the right to privacy in a public space and can have videos and pics taken regardless of how you feel sadly thats a legal amendment that I do support for good reason but when it comes to this that makes these situations hard, I don't want my own mother having any sort of pictures or videos of my kids for reason. And my brother constantly sends them to her against my own will. I don't like him doing that. I've told him he's not allowed to do that and he still doesn't behind my back because she deserves to know what she's missing out on is his point of view. I don't feel like that's a good enough. Excuse because I don't want her seeing my kids after everything. She put me through so and there's nothing I can do about that.  Other than stop giving him pictures.But then he just gets them from other people who he knows has them, thats one of the few reasons why he's not allowed around me either anymore [Practical Advice]"
"I male/18, met my girlfriend female/16. 6 months ago. It was online. She lives in Syracuse, NY, and I live in NYC 3 and half hour ride. We always made plans to meet up, the first time it went bad her dad, got upset and told me to not contact her anymore, and threatened me. When I first met her she told me she was 17 turning 18 in October. So she lied about her age I didn't find this out till yesterday.
After the first incident she would text me asking to to talk again. I said okay but it has to be a secret. Long story short we finally agreed to meet which was yesterday 6/29. I got her a bus ticket to come here. Things went well, blah blah. Her dad finds out he calls her and they start calling me. Then a deputy calls me too. He told me I wasn't in trouble. I spoke to her dad and helped him have him support and said I was sorry, and I didn'tnt know she was 16. I told the cop what I should do after this if I should block her, stop telling to her. And he said ""do nothing"" her dad thanked me for being supportive and everything. Then he sent me a text this morning saying how we would appreciate if me and her don't talk anymore and the police advise it too. I spoke to the cop and he said I am not in trouble. I don't wanna give up on her because she was there on my lowest time. I was thinking of calling the dad and telling him I feel, and how I wanna fix things. There are many things wrong with this story young man. She lied to you about her age. That is statutory rape in the state of NY. Why would you give your trust and respect to someone that would not only lie to you but put you in harms way? Do you think you are the only guy she is talking to and doing this with as well since you met her online? You are 3 hours away, you don’t even know her full situation. You need to take a step back and think about this. [Emotional Support]"
"I am M 19 and she is F 20. We’ve been friends for just over 2 years now. In the beginning we always met with other friends but this year we started meeting each other one on one. I asked her one time if she wanted to go shopping and she said yes, we’ve been out quite a few times alone and last week we met up to go to the gym together then grab a snack after. Yesterday we went to the movies together. And she makes it clear that she doesn’t go out with other people a lot, but I believe that the things we do, we could just be doing them as friends. She is very introverted and I don’t know what a subtle hint is for her. I like her and I want to tell her but I don’t know how without maybe losing our friendship if she doesn’t like me back, what should be my next move? [deleted] [Not Relevant]"
"How do I (32F) explain to my ex (32M) that I made a mistake breaking up?   Nearly a year ago I made the very painful decision to breakup with my wonderful partner because he decided he doesn’t want kids and I did. This decision wasn’t made lightly and it was painful to end our relationship when we were still in love, but at the same time, he was also struggling mentally and he told me if he wasn’t focusing on me he’d put that focus on him.   

I thought I was making the right decision for both of us, without me he could help himself and wouldn’t need to put any of his energy into me.  

 In the time since, I’ve seen one other guy but ended it because I wasn’t ready or interested. My main prerogative has been finding myself, travelling, joining groups, focusing on my health etc.  

The thing is, this whole time I’ve not been able to imagine a future with ANYONE else but my ex, I’ve not been interested in trying to find anyone new (the guy I was seeing was an old friend who asked me out organically). I’ve had other men approach me but I’ve just not wanted to date.   

Lately I’ve been thinking about my ex nearly all day and I’m not sure how to proceed, because in this time I’ve decided that I actually don’t mind if I don’t have children, I’d rather just have him   

Now, I know he felt abandoned by me and he’s very stubborn. We’ve not spoken for probably 8 months… So how would I reach out or is moving on my only? I’m so anxious about not having the opportunity to see him again, I feel like I totally messed up but it was with our best interest at heart, I never wanted to hurt him, I wanted my absence to heal him.   Man, adulting is so hard. I feel really broken.  You made the right decision to break up, it’s a hard decision and you just need to give it time. You’re saying that you don’t mind not having children but this is likely not true, you miss him and trying to convince yourself you can be happy without having kids. I think you should focus on yourself and starting dating when you’re ready [Emotional Support]"
"my bf of 4 years cheated on me with my bestfriend for months. Would y’all stay too? We don’t have kids or aren’t married (thank god lol). Recently moved to San Diego, CA and prices are no joke here. That’s the biggest thing i’m considering before deciding to leave. He always talked about marriages and babies so this was the last thing i expected. Apologizes for being naive as my mind is telling me to run for the hills but my heart wants me to stay🥹Do all men cheat? Once a cheater always a cheater? Will he actually change? 
 That’s many lies over an extended period of time. He doesn’t respect you as his partner or as a person. Be done. He’s shown you who he is, believe him. Look a little further north or east, if you can commute. It is more affordable. [Practical Advice]"
"I’ve made it two the fourth date with a couple of women only to fall flat on my face and get rejected the next day.

In looking back I’ve realized that I treat the fourth date just like the first date meaning I’m just having fun and maybe asking some top level questions. 

So what is the expectation of a fourth date from a women’s perspective?! 

 I just had my 4th date with a guy. But just to preface, we are going super slow! We took our dogs out and went hiking for a couple hours. It was super chill, easy, kinda like hanging with a friend. But like a sexy friend. We admitted later that day that we were checking each other out the whole time haha. But again, we're going slow. We arnt being romantic yet or being physical. We are establishing a friendship as a foundation and seeing how compatible we are.

I honestly think that there's no template or protocol when it comes to dating. Some people's fourth dates will be wildly different than other peoples. It all comes down to preference. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I tend to jump into things too fast. I’m wondering, how long do you guys feel comfortable with keeping things casual while going on dates and having sex before you want to take things to exclusivity? I am looking for something longterm, but want to be rational and not suffocating. Maybe also mention how often you hung out regularly. 
 I won't consider it until after at least 10 dates and at least a dozen hook ups. [Commentator's opinion]"
"My gf wants one but I have no idea how to do it I tried three times on her wrist but it still doesn't work, I bite a small area with my lips and suck it but still nothing shows up. Any ideas? Hickeys are made with intense sucking, not biting. Depending on your lip shape and mouth size, it might be tricky, especially if you are doing it on a thicker piece of skin. There’s a reason people always have neck hickeys: because they show up real easy.

The best advice to a good hickey is
1. Don’t hold back on sucking. It’s important to incorporate more then just sucking, but you gotta pull hard to make a mark
2. Do it on a place of the body that has looser/thinner skin (neck, thighs, chest)
3. Commit to it for sometime. It takes a second to do a good hickey, be a little patient 
4. Keep your lips in one place. If you are sucking hard on the skin, you should essentially be trapping the skin. Think about your lips like they are an empty water bottle, if you squeeze it tight against it, the skin should suck in and remain there for a while, same with your lips. It’s more of a tight space/air game then it is a mouth one. 
5. Accept that it can’t guarantee a hickey. Depending on your GF, she might not bruise all that easy, so it might be harder to leave a mark. 


Hopes this helps! [Practical Advice]"
"my boyfriend (26M) and I (24F) have been dating for around 3 months. yesterday, his ex reached out to me and told me that my boyfriend has been liking her instagram stories. she sent me screenshots of him liking recent stories of her, even one in a bikini. she said he also swiped up on one, and they messaged for 4 days (when I asked what they talked about she said it was just about work but why keep the conversation going for so long?)

idk how to feel. I know social media isn’t real life but i’ve never had anyone reach out to me before. is this a big deal or am I overreacting? I don’t like the idea of my boyfriend liking another girls story let alone his ex  I think she’s trying to break you two up, and start drama. You shouldn’t trust her. Why else would she rat on your bf if she is on good terms with him? Seems like shady behavior. [Commentator's opinion]"
"My boyfriend and I have been together for over a year now.
Over the past year there have been some worrisome signs of abuse as follows:
* He has used swear words while fighting with me (he was the one to start verbal abuse and over time I also retaliated by swearing back). He has called me a dumb b!tch, c*unt, piece of sh!t, lazy useless pig, fagg0t, l0ser.
* He used to punch walls and throw stuff in anger including my belongings and his phone
* He has driven the car rashly and angrily while I was sitting in the passenger seat
* He has brought his hand up to my throat momentarily during a bad fight and later said it was just to get me to stop talking
* He has twisted my arm during a fight and it kept hurting for 2-3 days after but he said he did it playfully like he would with one of the boys and that he did not know it would hurt me
* During a fight he said over phone ""I will punch your face and make you bleed"" (this was the most recent)


He says he's reducing such reactions and controlling his anger. The physical part has stopped since but the verbal abuse still continues to an extent.
I got scared and shared some of this with my mother and she wants me to call it off.

He comes from a dysfunctional family and I feel bad for what he went through, being raised by a single mother. And he is also responsible for her financially.
We are also from different religions so that's another point of contention for him (I'm secular so I am tolerant of his religion but he isn't much of mine. He wants our future kid to follow his religion).

The reason I have stayed:
He has promised it will get better and I do love him a lot and the good times have been really good. And I saw myself marrying this man. He can be a very caring and loving and trustworthy partner.

I have seen some improvement in him, but I do feel disrespected at times in this relationship. I'm scared of a future where I'll be in an abusive marriage.
Because I have read that most men do not improve/change.

I would like some advice and for others to share their experiences. Have you faced such a situation before and has your partner improved/changed?
I feel completely confused as to how to proceed, and some insights would be helpful.
I will also speak to my therapist about this. Please save me from every woman that is actively being abused and still thinking they can fix him.

“Ohhh but the good times are so good”, it’s not signs of abuse, you’re being abused regularly and if you give him warning that you’re leaving your life will be in danger.

I hope you can tell some trusted people and get away safely. [Commentator's opinion]"
"So I've known this girl for almost 2 years now (since September 2022). We were together for 10 months before breaking up, then we got back together again recently, but even throughout the time we were not together, we were practically still together, with us doing everything except making it official. Lately, we don't enjoy talking to each other over phone or over texts. I told her about how I felt, and she said it was the same for her. It's different in person, though, as we both really enjoy our conversations in person. The problem here, though, is that we can't have a decent conversation over texts or on a phone call anymore, and I'm not sure why. At first, I thought that it was because we knew each other for almost 2 years, with us texting every day during that time, but now I am thinking that this is not the case anymore. I love her a lot, and I know I love her because I do not have feelings towards her anymore but I still choose her 100% of the time over any other girl in the world. She says its the same for her but I start to question this because she said that she is not feeling the relationship anymore and that she feels irritated when she texts me or when we talk on a call due to her feeling like there is a double meaning or a hidden intention behind everything I say. She says its not the same in person, however, so I am confused over this. The easy solution would just be to go out more, but we can't go out a lot because she has strict parents and there is some distance between us.  I tried talking to her about this, but she doesn't completely understand her own feelings, and neither do I. On one hand, I don't really think I care, but at the same time, it's eating at me with every passing moment. I watched my favourite football team play today and win their match, but throughout the whole match, this situation was on my mind. I really love this girl, and I put my all into the 2 years we knew each other, but I feel like we may come to an end. I don't usually ask for relationship advice but I really do not know what's next for me to do, so if there is anyone on here that could help, please let me know what I could do to take my next step. i know it feels so significant rn, but you guys are so young. why not break up and come back if it’s convenient? you’ve done it before (edit bc that’s blunt: if you aren’t in love with someone at 18 that’s normal, go test your options and you might find something for both of you that fits better) [Practical Advice]"
"I’m 25m, she’s 25f. So long story short, I met this girl at work through tinder. She works in a different department but at the same site. Anyway, she was cool and we started chatting. She said she’s never been in a relationship which is fair enough, and she was ready for one which is what I’m in the search for. Anyway, we went on a few dates, kissing, sex and all was seeming well, then just out of no where, I’m not ready for a relationship can we just be friends. I asked her, please don’t break my big heart at the start, if you don’t think you’re ready please let’s just, we’ll leave it here, but she insisted she was ready and now here we are. I just dunno how to react. I’m frustrated, slightly angry and don’t want to waste anymore time with her but we work for the same company and cross paths occasionally… Grow up. 


She doesn't owe you sex or a relationship. She can consent to whatever she wants and if not, that's none of your business. 


Leave her alone. And no, she didn't 'use' you, you're just whining because you didn't get what you want. This is a tantrum and nothing more. [Hurtful]"

"Okay me (f25) and my best friend (f22) each have boyfriends, in her case more of a situationship of several MONTHS. Our guys happen to be bestfriends as well. Both ""boyfriends"" previously have kids from past relationships. Recently my friend moved out of state for her job, and her situationship stayed for his. 

(Here's the tea about her boyfriend) He refuses to be committed to her despite her begging and pleading. Every now and then his baby momma (who is married with another kid) comes from states away to bring his daughter to see him. While the daughter is sleeping, he has sex with his ex in the hotel room. He also has a tinder and meets random girls. This is hard because ive known for quite some time and dont know how to tell her. Its hard to give advice to someone when i know the dirt that is being done. I hate being in the middle. I told my boyfriend i was going to tell her but he told me not to.

"Heya, my gf 21f and I 23m have had a rocky start to our long distance, for reasons I can’t be arsed to type out to be honest. Anyway scene set and moving on. 

Naturally as we’ve begun long distance, and it’s started imperfectly and been handled imperfectly since, there’s been a few things brought up to each other. One thing I was aware of before but now I see it growing more as a problem is that she tells her mom every time we have a fight. I don’t know how much info she gives, I doubt all of it because to be honest some of these circumstances have only arose because of her actions. But regardless, I’m more aware of how her parents view of me is probably pretty bad, she says they like me, although don’t believe it and she wouldn’t say they didn’t like me even if they did, I don’t think. 

She has brought up comments from her mom in several conversations about these things, all revolving around the general idea that I’m being too harsh/mean/judgemental etc. I find it difficult because I do still have some genuine concerns for how our relationship is changing, and very little is being done to combat them. And now I feel I can’t bring anything up because it could upset her and make her family dislike me more. 

I can give more detail if you guys think it’s needed for this situation, but I’m mainly wondering how to approach this subject fairly, as I know she’s close with her family, or if it’s reasonable or justified at all to be thinking about it. For me, a boundary between our relationship and the opinions of family and friends should be made so that we can solve these things internally. I mean if we can’t solve it internally, that’s a pretty bad omen right? 

Or possibility two, am I just being too unreasonable should I just lay off and deal with the issues I have on my own 
 There should be a balance here. She is entitled to seek support from her loved ones, including her family.  That includes relationship issues. It's not reasonable to ask her to only discuss relationship issues with you.


But she should also be keeping in mind that complaining or venting about you too much, too often, will poison her loved ones against you.  It's up to her to be thoughtful about only seeking that support when it's really needed and not every time anything goes wrong. 


I think you can tell her, once, that you get worried her family only hears bad things about you, and that you're hoping she balances it out by talking about the good stuff, too.


Beyond that I would worry less about how she's seeking support and more about why you're fighting so much that this is even an issue. Fix the underlying relationship problems and this part will fix itself. [Commentator's opinion]"
"Context: we fought, haven’t spoken to each other in 3 days. She works late night during weekends 7pm - 7am shifts. 

I ignored her for few days she got mad. And now she seemed my text and hasn’t texted me in 2 days. She’s trying to get even. I can feel our relationship is heading to toxicity. 

We are probably both stubborn. No one wants to text first. And she hasn’t done anything shady to make me question her. To be honest. This is our first fight.

Yesterday she posted a selfie on her instagram story as well. I am also not sure if it was directed to me. Or she’s fishing for a new guy. (This is a pattern I saw for my exes) and it was 50/50. The one that posted with “skin” usually wants to fish. But she just posted a selfie. No skin or anything revealing. With music something along the lines of “f&$& love, I don’t need it” 

I am not sure what to do. She said she doesn’t use her phone at work. I caught her lying. I just haven’t told her that. She doesn’t text me at work but she texts other people.

She’s working right now. Only during weekends. 

We text on Instagram. I see her online on whatsapp. 

I just need help. It’s our first fight. 
Am I being paranoid? Is she being shady? Do girls chat late at night? Who could she be texting at this hour? (It’s 2 AM here currently)
 This is baby behavior…getting into an argument and then ignoring each others’ texts. Come on.  It’s one thing to cool down over night or something, but days?  Neither of you should be in a relationship if that’s how both act. Man up and text her you’d like to talk about the other day and have an adult conversation and come to a resolution. If she doesn’t respond like and adult within a few hours to that text, then say it’s clear that you two aren’t ready for an adult relationship and move on. This is not how to handle disagreements.

"I have noticed on at least two occasions that the contents of my wallet have been fanned out as if they were deliberately taken out and looked at after spending the night at my gfs house. I didn’t notice either time until after I left and got home. We have been dating for about 5 months now and she hasn’t said a word about it. I’m not really sure how to approach this. My past girlfriends have usually respected my privacy. I keep mulling over in my head exactly how I’m going to ask her why she keeps doing this, without her becoming defensive. I know damn sure I’m not the first guy who has encountered this kind of behavior. So, can anyone who’s dealt with this before tell me how you handled it, and what happened? TIA.

"My bf and I have been dating for 4 months. I'm definitely not planning to have children with him yet. But since he keeps fantasizing about children, a wife and a house every day I decided to find out his ""timeline"". When I asked him he told me he isn´t even sure about wanting children, just discussing what if´s. He wants to live his life for the next 4-5 years and then maybe he´s ready. Maybe it´ll never happen. Okay. I continued to ask for his reason for maybe wanting children out of interest and he told me there is someone there to take care of him when he´s old. Idk what to think about this. My first reaction would be that I love children and want to see someone grow up. Imo demanding care from a child is unrealistic at best bc you never know if you get along and if the child wants to do it. His second reason is that is the ultimate proof of love since it´s a combination of both partners DNA. And also the love you feel towards a child is on a whole different level than everything else which i kind of get. Idk but the first reason that came up to his mind kind of irritates me  > he told me there is someone there to take care of him when he´s old. Idk what to think about this.

Just ask more questions about it. Why was this the first thing coming to his mind? How does he imagine the process of RAISING kids? Will he take time off/reduce to working part-time to be there for them? Will he be willing to be the primary parent/emergency contact? What happens if the child is disabled? What if the child has mental health issues? etc. etc..

> His second reason is that is the ultimate proof of love since it´s a combination of both partners DNA. 

What happens if him and his partner can't have kids the ""natural""way? What if his sperm is an issue? [Practical Advice]"
"36F - Are girls really out here “using”men for free meals? I have had a few guys tell me that girls they’ve gone on dates with from apps are using them for free meals.  I love a good meal but this seems ridic to me. 
One guy even asked me if I was going to pay for myself before we even met up, which made me really uncomfortable. I was raised very traditional so there are some aspects that I enjoy about dating a man but I don’t need a stranger paying for my meal; I’m not homeless. The way I was raised was if a guy asks me on a date and he’s picking the place, he’s taking me out and I’m assuming he had the funds to cover it. Whether I like him enough to go on a second date does not determine whether I offer to pay for myself, which I always do, and depending on the situation I may let him pay that time. I only do this if I am certain I want to go out with him again and there are no major red flags waving. 
Backstory- in my 20s, I did experience some backlash from men who I let pay for me and did not want to go on a second date with. 
Obviously there’s still a huge wage gap so I am not saying I think every girl can do this, especially if she has kids, but I think in general it is a good policy I’ve stuck to because then guys can’t hold it over us later. Just wondering if there are truly women out there doing this whole “free meals” thing or if that is a myth bc the guys make it seem rampant!
 There are absolutely people looking for free things. I'm not saying quid pro quo where the person who didn't post is owed anything,  but the first date should be split. 


I had a date I was asked on.  The woman ordered a fresh juice,  appetizer, coffee,  20$ lunch item, dessert and an espresso coffee item. I ordered a 7$ lunch. 

The bill came and she loudly proclaims,  don't worry,  I'll get the tip.

The bill was 70$ and I ordered 10% of it. 

I sat there in awe and put a 20$ on the table and watched her whip out her cell phone calculator smashing the screen in a fury and she got visibly agitated.

I just walked out with the 20$ left. [Commentator's opinion]"
"My girlfriend came around to my house yesterday were we just hung out and watched some videos. Couple hours later she was on top of me and pushed for sex so I reciprocated. One thing led to another and I was fingering her. Eventually she wanted penetrative sex so she got on top and this is where problems arrive.

She had her orgasm took a couple seconds break as she aways does. Usually we switch position because I don't get enough stimulation when she's on top but she carried on going.

A minute after we carried on fucking and all of a sudden she complained of pain in her stomach. I asked if she was okay and she carried on going. She said she had pain again and so I said ""do you want to stop?"". She said ""yes"" so I immediately stopped. 

She hadn't complained about stomach pain before or after we had sex so I was maybe wondering if I did anything wrong.

The past 3 times we've had sex she has acted a little different. The first 1/3 she had her orgams and then when it was my turn decided I had to jerk myself off whilst she watched (I did kind of enjoy it). The 2/3 times my parents were in the next room so we were trying to be really quiet, which didn't work too well and so she suggested we stop penetrative sex (because it was too loud) and I jerk myself off again. And the 3/3 was what I've just said above (obviously i didnt jerk myself off this time because it was obviously not the right moment)

Quite a few times she has brought up what blue balls feels like so I confused to wether this is mayne a kink or an actual problem. She did have a panic attack the day before so maybe it has something to do with that. When I asked her what was wrong she just kept saying ""I don't know"". So I'm really not sure what to do or how to get her to open up about it.

If it is a kink I'm more than happy to try it, in fact I have a similar kink that goes hand in hand. But if this is an actual problem she's having why doesn't she want to tell me what's going on.

Relationship is fairly fresh, we met around 2 and a half months ago and because boyfriend and girlfriend one month ago. It sounds like she may have hit/ bruised her cervix. Especially during orgasm, she may not pay attention to the angle and intensity of her movements which can result in her going too deep and pushing on her cervix. This can result in extremely painful period like cramping, that she will likely only realize afterward. Ibuprofen and/or heat can help alleviate this. In the future, try encouraging her to lean forward/ not go as deep while on top. Or make sure she is warmed up really well before riding as arousal makes the vaginal canal lengthen, decreasing the likelihood of hitting her cervix. Other DP positions would be good to look out for as well. Let her take the lead as far as depth and intensity. [Practical Advice]"
"I (23F) have a (30M) boyfriend, and he sometimes talks to me in a pet voice or as if he is talking to a child when it comes to intimate things. If I flash him he starts talking in a pet voice like ""wow"" or ""omg you look so nice"" but all in a way as if a kid was holding a drawing, instead of a deep voice and the way that he talks too makes me feel less of a hot or sexy woman and more as a cute kid. I asked him about it he said because he loves me and sees me as his baby that he respects, and doesn't want to be disrespectful to, but i'm not sure how to feel. Before we started dating and we were friends and he would tell me about all his dirty experiences and how flirty he was, frankly he had wondering eyes in the beginning and that led to some infidelity (we are trying to move on from that). I've seen his texts calling other women hot and bad, but i'm just cute and beautiful in his eyes. I'm not sure if he's just not attracted to me in that manner and that's why all these issues stemmed and why he talks that way and doesn't treat me like an actual woman in that sense. I am still going over the infidelity thing out (happened 7 months ago, not physical, but i found out 3 months ago) and it has been hard to get my confidence back or be convinced that he truly is attracted to me in a sexy manner. Can someone knock some sense in me? Is he attracted to me?  Who knows maybe you’re just cute. I don’t know. Good luck. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I need to vent to some bros

Had two dates with this cute girl, had a little foreplay before I dropped her off after 2nd date. A lot of laughs and stayed texting a lot between. 3rd date she was gonna come over and hangout for the evening. Very sensual and ended up fucking for 5 hours on/off. Some of the best sex of my life and felt like we had a real connection. She definitely had multiple O’s and she even said I was an undercover pornstar(literally best compliment I’ve ever received). She gave every indication that she absolutely loved it, even the following days she sent me a couple memes on Insta describing how good the sex was. 
The following week we had plans and at the very last minute cancels our plans after leaving me on read for 2 days but says how she was so excited for our plans and that we’ll rain check. 
Following that, she completely ghosts me while posting on her fucking story 😂 so I text her letting her know I appreciated the time spent and I hope she finds what she is looking for. 
Which she then replies saying she enjoyed the time and just wants to be friends.

I’ve definitely done my fair share in my past so no hard feelings, but damn. I deadass have never felt so played in my whole life 😂  Karma [Hurtful]"
"Not really what you'd think lol 

My spouse and I have been married for about 15 years. They came out as Trans/ACE. We have a great partnership - coparent, split finances, live as best friend roommates. There is zero sexual or overly intimate (cuddles, kisses, etc.) between us. They are perfectly happy, and all of their needs are met. 

However, some of my needs are not being met. The intimacy, having a masculine presence, etc.. It was suggested that I start dating.

My question: I am married. I have a roommate who is also my child's parent. The relationship is strictly platonic. How would I address this with potential dates? Would dates even be possible?

*No we aren't planning on divorcing or living apart. It isn't financially smart, nor does it align with how we parent and want our kid raised.* I am looking for masculine friends who can (hopefully) fill the need for intimacy (no ons, f.buddy, etc relationship).* Put your status on dating apps as polyamorous. When people reach out, explain to them what you explained to us. You'll probably get a bunch of guys looking to hook up and bounce, which I don't get the impression is what you want, but you may also have an issue with guys opening up and being intimate with you when you still live with the child's other parent.

"I could really use some perspective here. I'm feeling conflicted about my friendship with K (30M), and I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or if my concerns are justified. We've been friends for five years online, initially bonding over a video game and chatting on Discord. At first, we were close, and he even used to give me in-game currency bought with real money. However, things changed when I turned down his romantic advances – the gifts stopped, and so did much of our communication.

Months later, we reconnected, and he apologized, but I noticed he started showering other women online with gifts and attention instead. It frustrated me because I saw these women taking advantage of his generosity while he seemed oblivious, just craving companionship. Our friendship became strained as I couldn't stand watching this dynamic play out daily.

Recently, he's become very close to a married woman in our game community, showering her with gifts and money. It's escalated quickly over just a few months, and he considers her his best friend now. I've repeatedly advised him to be cautious with his money and to value himself more, especially now that he's not trying to win someone's affection but just being generous to a friend.

I've voiced my concerns to him and others in our circle because I've known him for years and have seen this pattern before. However, it seems I've upset everyone by talking behind their backs and making assumptions. I feel torn because I care about K and want to protect him from being taken advantage of, but I also realize he's an adult who can make his own decisions.

Am I wrong for speaking up? Is there a way to handle this situation better? He knows exactly what he’s doing and your own history with him on his vices makes this issue murky for you to get involved in, in my opinion.  although I understand how frustrating it must be to watch go down if you care about the guy.  People self destruct in all kinds of ways, it sucks you have to watch it go down like that but frankly he could probably self destruct in worse ways.  Sorry, I’m sure that doesn’t make you feel better.  But from the way you have told the story, I believe he and everyone is aware of this woman’s marital status?  It sounds like he will be spending his money on egirls who take advantage of him one way or another, perhaps at least this is a more stable situation since he and everyone knows she’s married?  Ultimately it boils down to not your circus, not your monkeys and you need to not get involved or people are going to read into your meddling as jealousy since you once benefitted from his self destruction before you rejected him.  I’ve been there and it’s rough being a girl online that way sometimes but it’s just gonna be drama you don’t need to get involved with.  Honestly considering the type of friendship he clearly craves id honestly be most interested in distancing myself from that guy.  It’s just not gonna be a good look and frankly you know exactly the only kind of attention he really wants… [Commentator's opinion]"
"I M18 have a crush on my friend who I will call ,S (F18) for reference we are both in high school but don’t go to the same school I met her about a year ago through a friend and we quickly became friends. I cannot tell if S thinks of me as more than a friend though. A few weeks ago we were at a party and her ride left before we got locked in I told her that she could sleep in my car she said she would bc she knows that I’m a guy that she can trust. So whenever I went to bed that night she was already asleep and whenever I woke up she was already awake and my head was on her lap. I apologized for that but she just laughed and said she didn’t mind. About 2 weeks ago we were texting late at night and the only part I remember about that is that I told her that I think she is very beautiful she told me that that was sweet of me but, she then asked me if I was drunk (I was) and I answered honestly, she responded with “you’re such a flirt when you’re drunk” which I thought she was trying to flirt with me there. Last week I asked one of our mutual friends (J) if S thought of me as more than a friend. Our friend didn’t directly ask S that question but J said she thinks that S sees me as a close friend. 2 days ago we were on a friends boat and it was very crowded me and S sat at the front of the boat and she used  my lap as a footrest she kept touching me with her feet too and we sat there together for like an hour talking. Last night S invited me as her +1 to a party we were there for about 30 minutes then the cops showed up and we ended up separate ways and we ended up at 2 different party’s but we were both to intoxicated to go get each other. So what I really want to know is should I take a chance at ruining our friendship and ask her personally If she wants to be more than friends or should I just stay friends and see what happens? Get a pair and make a move.  You’re only 18 once.  Don’t be 5 years from now looking back on it and wonder what might have happened if you asked out that girl back in high school.   Staying friends and “see what happens” is not a good strategy.  

Look - the biggest mistake guys make is they often have someone interested right in front of them and fail to take chances.  

Plan a date.  Ask her if she wants to do something with you.   Get some food and go a park or beach, mini golf, amusement park, or something along those lines. [Practical Advice]"
"My (38M) girlfriend (31F) of almost 2 years moved in with me last week. In the weeks leading up to it we were fighting more and more to the point where we almost called the move, and almost even the relationship, off. After taking some space to gain clarity and peace again, I came back every time telling her that we should give it another try, lessons learned, let's be better.

Our relationship dynamic is classic avoidant (me) with anxious attachment (her). However, I feel I deserve a medal or something, for the enormous progress I have made to opening my heart more, doing what feels like ""risking"" intimacy and staying present. I really want to make it work this time, because after a divorce 7 years ago and 3 failed relationships after that, I'm just tired of failing relationships and take responsibility for my contributions to those failures. As a matter of fact, I was the one who always breaks up. So I'm trying something new - find a quality partner and stick it out.

So I've been regulating my reactions and mood exceptionally well even if I have to say so myself. I don't snap at her, there are no sting in my tone of voice. However she just can't seem to help herself sometimes. Getting short, cold, critical. And these things flair up my anxieties. I also feel a sort of anger, because the things she says is falsely accusatory and overall just super negative energy to be around. She wasn't always like this, but after learning about how overbearing and dominating and bullying her father was when growing up, it's like she's still acting out against that, even today. She needs to be loud and be heard because her voice was always silenced when she was young.

Either way, it makes me to overall feel quite miserable much of the time. It feels like I have to walk on eggshells, or she'll just explode. I don't know when she's okay and when not. Trying to bring things I feel is important to discuss up with her is received extremely poorly. And all these behaviours only came out about 6 months ago. I feel my happiness has taken a severe knock. All I am left to do is try to forgive her as best I can and meet her again with care and love.

Is it supposed to feel this miserable? I thought I'd really give a long-term relationship an honest try, and thought she would be a good partner, but I'm hating most of it right now. Please give me some advice or hope?? Thank you. Why would you actively choose to stay in a situation that makes you miserable just for the sake of ""sticking it out""? [Not Relevant]"
"So I feel in a slump. I'm 31 and still have never been married. Most of my 20s I was working and going to school full time to get my 3 degrees. 

I feel unlucky in love. My longest relationship ended because he cheated. And I just had a relationship of two months end because he said he's too busy for a girlfriend. 

I just feel like I'll never meet my husband and I won't have a partner in life. 

I'm starting to question what is so wrong with me. 

I'm a really not pretty enough, or smart enough or funny enough? 

Advice please.  Hey you’re not alone. I got cheated on by my long term bf too and im so glad i didnt marry the wrong person. I get your frustration but dont change to get more dates. Be authentically you and eventually you’ll meet someone that clicks. Are you smart enough? Girl you have 3 degrees! That’s so impressive!!! If you truly want to be happy, don’t force connections or settle for someone just to add a checkmark to your list. My uncle and his wife didnt meet until they were 35. It takes time to meet the right person but i know you will eventually. Hang in there💕 [Emotional Support]"
"How should I tell her? Do you think this is the end if I bring it up now? I feel that I have to bring it up no matter what but how should I go about it?

We have been in a relationship for 1 year and she asked about my degree and I just kind of brushed it off till her friend asked me and I lied. I have stuck to that but try to not bring it up too much. Now I love her and can’t get a good night sleep because of the stress this is causing me. I have so much anxiety about this I am basically stressing all day and night. 

For a bit of background, I went to school but left after a year to take care of an ex with medical problems, it was a mistake but I got a fine job and kept moving up there. The pay was fine and it allowed me to take care of my ex. That relationship ended and I moved one 2 years past and I met my now girlfriend. She is lovely and I am lucky but it hurts every time school is brought up. I don’t know how to break it to her and what to do next. 

I also have been looking for jobs and she is so supportive but I can’t tell her the reason I don’t get the job is because of my degree status. Most of my friends know and they let it slip every so often over the last year but she seems to not notice. I am a fool for not telling her sooner but now I am here and need some advice.

Anyhow this is a throwaway and I really just need some advice on next steps.

TL:DR I fucked up told my GF I have a college degree when I don’t, now I need to tell her, but how? You’ll just have to tell her and risk losing her. Losing her would be better than holding in the anxiety of the lie. It sucks that her friends and family also have been told the lie, so that’ll be embarrassing. But I don’t think people care as much as you would think. You slipped up and lied about something early in your relationship and it snowballed, pretty common thing. You’re also young so nothing is stopping you from getting that degree if you want to. I would decide in your mind when you’re going to tell her and just follow through. Ex “I’m seeing her tomorrow I am absolutely telling her then no excuses”. Say something like “hey there’s something I need to be honest with you about. I’m really sorry but I lied about having a degree. I’m insecure about not having one which is why I lied, and once I told the lie it felt hard to get out of. Now that we’re in a serious relationship, I’ve realized honesty is required, and I’m telling you this bc I love you and want a future with you. I would understand if a lie of this magnitude makes you reconsider the relationship, and am here for you regardless of what you decide.” Owning up to this will be an opportunity to grow regardless of the outcome. Good luck. [Practical Advice]"
"Hii I would love to hear your opinions. Me (20F) and my boyfriend(23M) have only been together for a few months now and I had went to his house the other day for the first time. when I was there he had a surprise for me and it was lingerie. There was 2 body suits both a size small and I am a bit chubby so I fit medium or large and he knows that. As I was looking at it, it had no new tags, the brand was Fenty. He had me try one and it couldn’t even get passed my tits, then as I was going to try on the next one, I literally looked at the crotch and there was dry DISCHARGE literally I got so grossed out. I didn’t say anything at all to him and told him I didn’t want them, they don’t even fit. I felt weird the rest of the day with him and went home early. Now I’m thinking where did he get the lingerie? who wore this lingerie? To be honest after thinking I feel like he stole it from his sister or still had it from a previous relationship, which he hasn’t been in one for “years”. He is now my ex  Eeeeeeew!!! How does a man not notice this!? Id ask him next time and show him tbh. I'd be like ""Wild you tried to give me this, look here babe - there's discharge from someone else vagina. Where did you even get these? And what made you think I could fit them/want them?"" But maybe that's because I'm direct and like to address issues when they happen. Maybe he did truly order them for you and can show a receipt, who knows. [Commentator's opinion]"
"So basically I went through a break up, it was my first relationship stayed together for 2 years. She went abroad to study and started lying to me about her whereabouts the second she landed, was very disrespectful throughout the relationship, shit load of issues. Not nice to me at all but nice to everyone else like wtf is even that, I endured it all till that day i broke things off. People who got back together after a break up, why did you do it and did it get better this time?  Why do you want to get back together? It seems like she treated you bad and didn’t have respect for you. It seems like you idealize the fun times you had together and miss that. Unless she realizes that it was very bad what she did, and you trust that she can change.. i don’t see a reason to get back together. It’s also your first relationship, which means that it’s always special to you, but it also means you didn’t get to experience anything else and your judgement may be a bit, clouded I guess? 

Focus on you, and what you deserve. Your partner is a person that’s supposed to respect you and love you. And not treat you like crap. Do you want to spent the rest of your life with someone that treats you like crap? I don’t think so. 

So, focus on you, feel your heartbreak. Be sad, mourn the loss of the first relationship. You will heal, it is inevitable and that you will also inevitably find someone that deserves you and your time as you will also deserve theirs. (If you treat them right obviously) 

But the first break up ever, sucks the most because it’s the first time you’re feeling it.
Remember that! But you will heal. 

My advise, don’t get back together 

*Edited for spelling [Emotional Support]"
"My ex-boyfriend and I met while I was doing a semester abroad in Europe. He lives there and I live in the US. We met pretty early on in my semester so we were together for about 3 months before I had to go back home. Honestly, it was the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in. We talked every single day, and were quite inseparable. However, I expressed early on that I didn’t want to do long distance, which he understood despite our growing feelings for eachother. 

Because I knew I was leaving, I feel like I gaslit myself into believing I didn’t love him as much as I did. He really loved me and wanted to try and make it work, but I was still pretty adamant about splitting up when I got back home. For about a month after I got back we were still talking everyday, and basically still together (neither of us were interested in seeing other people). It wasn’t until a couple weeks ago that I finally actually split from him, and the reasoning was because ever since I’ve been home we’ve been arguing more. Most of our arguments have to do with him being a really jealous person, and getting upset when I’d tell him i’m seeing male friends of mine (basically all of my male friends are gay or in commited relationships, which I have emphasized many times ). So I ended it because I was tired of defending my innocent hangouts, but to be honest it was mainly because I felt like it needed to end anyway, since as I said I never wanted to do long distance. 

Now it’s been about two weeks since we split, and I can’t stop thinking about him. I feel that as more time passes the more I realize I really do love him and it’s hard to let go. Part of me feels like I took the easy way out instead of letting it take it’s course. Now I don’t know what to do, because I already ended it. And even if we got back together, I have no idea how we would move forward. I came here because I don’t know what to do or how to feel. I want to talk to him but I also don’t want to hurt him more or hinder his healing. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  The fact he is jelous and its causig arguments is a good indication you did the right thing. I get hes got insecurities with you away and having a social life etc. But thats one of the issues of a long distance relationship. And there isnt anything he can do about that, so being jelous and causing fights is not healthy. It would have lead to resentment over a few months.

Its gona sting for a bit. But it will fade. The fastest way to have it fade is to delete and block communication. But I doubt your want to do that. but i would refrain from communicating as its like a clock. With no communication the pain lessons, with communication it resets the clock. [Commentator's opinion]"
"
I was seeing this girl for 2 months, which is short but it was intense and serious (going out 3 times a week, some vulnerability around our issues and wanting to make this work). She recently decided that she’s going to her hometown for the summer (2 months), which prompted a very long and messy breakup. At first, she said that she feels like this won’t work long distance but was very insistent on being friends. 

I said that I can’t think of her platonically, and we agreed to just ‘take things as they come along’. We went out the next day, and she invited me over to her place and was being very affectionate overall and wanted to discuss what we’ll do while she’s away. Right before the day ended, she did a 180. She said that we’re going in circles, and that there’s already emotional distance here which means that long-distance will make it worse and that she lost romantic attraction.

I turned very cold and left, but reached out to her a few days later because I wanted closure. We met up, she told me that a joke I made that day threw her off. I had given her one of my bracelets, and she asked me if I wanted it back because we might not be on speaking terms by the time she’s back. I joked and told her that she can just give it to a mutual friend. This apparently prompted her to start thinking about how complicated the situation can end up being and made her ‘realize that she lost romantic interest’.

She said that she doesn’t usually like being friends with exs but that she wants to try with me, and asked if she can text me in a few days. I gave her a very halfhearted okay because I’m not sure if I wanna be friends but didn’t wanna make that decision now.

I’m just very confused right now because I feel that the joke I made wasn’t that big of a deal and she could’ve communicated that it made her uncomfortable. Was this actual loss of interest or a fear response? Is she likely to regain feelings once she’s back?

Also, I’m not sure whether she wants to be friends due to guilt or whether she really wants to.   Basically she doesn’t want you. That’s a hard thing to accept sometimes, but at least she didn’t string you along or cheat on you.  You’re young and there are always plenty of girls before you find the one.  She’s not the one.  Deep breath and let her go.  On to the next. :)

And if you can truly be her friend and take out the romantic side of things, then for sure go for it.  But if you can’t, best to just end it cold and call it a day. No use torturing yourself later. [Practical Advice]"
"my boyfriend and I have been together for over 1.5 years. We hang out alot, he normally initiates it and is good at balancing me with his friends, alone time, work and school. 

I notice that when he does ask to hang out, which is more than 4 times a week I always say yes. He’s still in school so he has a part time job that’s 4-cl and I have a full time 8-5. We normally hang out when he’s off and finishes at the gym. Even though I should probably be sleeping by the time he’s back for the gym, He still comes over or vice versa. 

Sometimes (which is rarely) when I ask him to hang out he’ll say he’s tired from work or wants to hop on the game but he’ll see me in a day or two. I have run into the issue that whenever he asks me, I always say yes even though I know I should take a rest or watch some tv by myself. He lives with his two best friends and I currently live alone, so I feel like I’m always alone and want to be with him. He doesn’t have that problem.

Today is sunday and he suggested that I come over after I finish my reset (we saw each other wednesday through saturday evening). In my head I know i should probably get to bed early for work- but I really would like to see him. I’m trying to figure out how to balance and just say no when I know I should probably stay home, or if it’s even healthy that I am so quick to say yes to hang out with him (or seeming desperate). 

TDLR: I have trouble saying no to hang out with my bf because i hate being alone. He’s fine with taking time for himself whenever he wants a day or two alone. I feel desperate.  Make a schedule of when you guys see each other. If it’s outside of the regular schedule, you don’t have to feel guilty for saying no. Also, it’s okay to want to see him frequently as long as you aren’t codependent and you don’t make him feel bad when he needs a break. [Commentator's opinion]"
"My boyfriend has always been a little chunky but reasonably fit, exercising 2-4 times a week depending on his schedule. We're not taking six pack fit, but just a mild 'dad bod'. It's never been a problem for me.

Recently, he's started turning his fitness journey up to eleven. He goes 48-72 hours without food and still trains Thai kickboxing during these prolong fasts. He started doing these things a couple of weeks ago and the weight is just shedding off. I'm so proud and happy for him, but as someone who has struggled with an eating disorder in the past, I'm worried that he may be developing one.

It seems like whenever we meet to eat, he's finally breaking a 40+ hour fast. And even when he does eat, he eats keto. Normally he'd grab something like a burger at our usual spot, but he's now opting for salad bowls with grilled chicken, eggs and no dressing. He says that he's avoiding carbs because it means he can get back to ketosis faster in his next fast, butt that sounded like someone with an ED rationalizing.

He says that what triggered this journey was him meeting an old friend from high school who told him he looked exactly the same as when he was in high school, when he was quite a bit heavier.

When I was younger, I struggled with orthorexia, so I'm worried about him. I know these kinds of comments can be the exact kind of fuel that develop into eating disorders.

When I brought up my concerns, he just laughed me off and explained that he was just trying to be healthier. He showed me fasting salts and multivitamins that he was using to convince me that the fasts weren't dangerous, but that really just made it feel worse to me. Like if you need pills to make sure you don't damage your body, surely what you're doing can't be healthy?

Despite my concerns, he's been going for some electric inbody scans at a health lab that have showed the fat literally just melting off. He's dropped like 3 kilos (6.6 pounds?) over 2 weeks and says that he'll stop once he loses another 2-3 kilos. But again, that sounds like what I'd tell myself when I was struggling with my ED.

So reddit, tell me if I should be concerned. Should I ask him to talk to a doctor? How can I help him out here? As a former wrestler and competitive martial artist during most of my school years. I saw this a lot and was warned by the coaches and the trainers not to do this.

Yeah, this is not good. He needs to eat more consistently and healthy and not starve his body…especially during training. Such crash dieting can lead to heart problems later in life and the body will scavenge the muscles for protein and fats to burn. This includes the heart.

He needs to go see his doctor, get a referral to a registered dietitian and perhaps a trainer that specializes in martial artists. [Practical Advice]"
"I broke up with my boyfriend last Monday.

Long story short, he really betrayed my trust and disrespected me.

Now it's been a week, he's saying that if we are a strong couple (like he thought we were) we should be able to move past this.
I feel as though I've been pretty strong for the past three years, moving past his occasional hurtful behaviors and boundary crossing. Of course it is not all bad, but there have been 4 major instances of disrespect or just flat out meanness.

Anyway. I am feeling really down and today I reached out asking if he could come over. He said yes but then I changed my mind, told him I had plans with friends. He was okay with that, but when I came home I told him it wouldn't be a good idea for us to hang out.

This is all so incredibly brief and missing a lot of details. So I guess my question is-- how do I stay strong, honor myself and my boundaries, and not cave in just to make him happy and take the oath of least resistance? I'm trying to do right by me, after taking one too many on the chin.  You can’t stay with him and also honor yourself.  Pick one. [Hurtful]"
"I'm 21 year old male long story short went round friends uni party met this girl around 2am she seemed interested in me started playing with my hair, tiggling me. 5am we left she went back to her flat I went downstairs to sleep, I then messaged her saying there's not space here to sleep can I stay round yours she said yes I went round there and we started cuddling, playing with my hair, tiggling 

I got more info from a friend the next day that she was mad that I didn't make any moves and that I was the first man she ever chased sorta thing. I knew I should've atleast kissed her that night I feel stupid but I'm not the most confident person so I didn't unfortunately. I did actually like her as shes the first girl that's ever showed me that much attention. 

I messaged her a couple of days after the party saying it was nice meeting you do you want to hang out some time and she hasn't responded for 5 days. It's literally the only thing on my mind and it's making me regret not doing anything that night. What I want to know is can I do anything or should I just leave it at that?  So all these words typed to random strangers. You could have already texted her again, and let her know you like her, you were too nervous to make a move, there was also alcohol involved, and you want to see her as your better self [Practical Advice]"

"Navigating a long-distance relationship for eight months, the relationship was lovely and straightforward. Both parties were happy and seriously committed. However, things soon turned darker as my trust issues were triggered by her outgoing vibes. She has an Instagram account with around 800 followers; she's popular, which means she gets a lot of attention and possibly admiration. I don't like to control her or anything; she used to reassure me every time I asked and even helped me with my overthinking whenever I asked something.

However, I always felt bothered by her interactions with guys, even though she assured me she didn't interact with any guys. Despite her reassurances, my trust issues and overthinking caused havoc and chaos. Every time I pressured her about something that bothered me, or about her past relationships, she would yell at me. She would say I was doubting her or not trusting her, and I don't blame her reactions since she had traumatic life experiences as much as I did.

Now, I feel like I lack self-respect for seeking her out while she's trying to go cold turkey and drop everything. I really, really love her and appreciate her company, and I cannot truly dare to move on without trying to show her I am not this kind of person. The trust issues and unhealthy behaviors were based on a previous traumatic experience where someone was lying to me the whole time. I'd be a fool to say I wasn't projecting my doubts and constant interrogations onto my girlfriend. I am genuinely regretful for becoming like this mid-relationship. All she sees now is an immature, selfish person who constantly doubts every move she makes.

I cannot give up on her just yet. I really want to put in the effort to show her I am different than all of this, but she insists on giving up and cutting me off. She is now trying to have no contact or even ghosting me for good.

Please, I need insights as I am desperately seeking to change for her and be as I used to be. Insight: If you refuse to accept that she has broken up with you that means that you are not just selfish, you are a monster. Your behavior is completely unacceptable. [Hurtful]"
"in my desire to get him to initiate sex, i’ve given him plenty of opportunities but he either doesn’t take them or he just waits for me to do it.

last night we were in bed, and he legit just laid his head on my breast, cuddling me and that was it. when i asked him later if he had been trying he said yes, badly.

we have been married for four years, and i really love the guy, but i never ever feel sexy or wanted or like sex is something he wants rather than something im making him do.

we have had this conversation a few times before, he knows what i like and he def knows what doesn’t work (had a bout of a few months of just rolling over and grabbing my breasts), and it got better for a bit (he was a bit more involved) but god, its really making me feel like shit and now i get the ick so bad i can’t take it.

its making me feel really ugly, and now late at night i get this lump in my throat and horrible cringe feeling. and i know we’re gonna have to talk about it *again*, but how do i stop feeling so gross about it and why does it keep happening? My last boyfriend made me feel the same. The way he approached me for sex was different than anyone I’d been with before. Normally I can tell when a man wants to have sex, but not him. I talked to him, and I think he tried to change. But it still was unlike anything I’ve experienced. Broke up tonight [Practical Advice]"
"So when I was in college last year, this guy who made the first move had walk up to me and talked to me on my table, ever since that we have became very close, gotten to know each other very well and had some romantic moments. Six months later he had to move to a different state due to personal problems and I was so sad and heart broken when that happened. 

When I got hired to a new job, I recently met this guy 3 weeks ago and he was showing me around and training me. We’ve talked and gotten to know each other slowly and seem to became interested in each other which made me happy that I can finally move on from the last guy, but that same day he told me he will be at work for 2 more weeks before leaving because he is going to the military. That made me sad and it seem like he was sad too, after that I never seen him again at work. 

Now a few days ago I met this guy from a dating app, we’ve matched before around 4 years ago but really never talked. But since we’ve matched again we started to talk more often and today I just found out he is moving to a different state.. after that I just wanted to cry because it seems like every time I think I’ve found the perfect guy to date that I’m very interested in.. it never goes as planned and it seems like I’m not lucky when it comes to dating. I don’t know if this is God way of telling me that, these guys I was interested in just isn’t the right one for me.. or keep waiting until god gives me the right man that will treat my like a priority and a queen because he knows I deserve that kind of love and treatment from the right man. ✨💕 Hmm is this a real post? If a guy likes you enough he would discuss the idea of you moving with him.

Only 2 things matter to guys. Your weight & your age. These guys are lying to you. [Hurtful]"

"So I have the opposite of the normal problem that most girls face with guys actions and words contradicting each other. I’ve been seeing this guy for the past month and I’ve unexpectedly fallen so hard for him. 

I’ve told him that I really like him and mentioned that I wasn’t sure what he was looking for and he confirmed that he is also not sure of what he’s looking for. We’re both in our mid twenties, I don’t know that he’s ever had a serious relationship before. He’s nothing like anyone I’ve ever met or dated- in all of the best ways. 

So he tells me he doesn’t know what he wants but his actions are telling me that he wants to be with me??? He does all of this super sweet stuff for me, is planning stuff for us to go do later in the summer. 

He makes “jokes” when I talk about my future goals of having a big farm “let’s do it” in reference to buying my dream piece of property. The first time we (unexpectedly) had sex he rubbed his hand up my leg- I hadn’t shaved in a week or so, I made a comment about it and he said “natural, sexy” and smiled at me. The next morning when we woke up he stared into my eyes for a moment, went to get up out of bed, leaned back in towards me to kiss me, turned to get off the bed and then leaned back in for another kiss and asked if I needed anything????

He fucking rubbed his nose on mine one of the first times we kissed???? Like just all of these sweet little gestures??? Am I crazy for thinking he’s in love with me???
 No he definitely is. [Commentator's opinion]"
"My boyfriend and I have been in a very committed relationship for 6 months. He is now backpacking Europe for two months. He invited me to join him for few weeks but I wasn’t able to travel for visa reasons. And tomorrow is our 6th month anniversary and he told me he is going sightseeing with a girl he met at one of the hostels. So apparently, there were about 10 people from that hostel that started hanging out together and that girl has a plan to go to the same city as my boyfriend tomorrow. So they decided to do sightseeing together. And I feel comfortable about the fact that he’s travelling alone with her especially on our anniversary day. Am I wrong that I get mad and jealous? My boyfriend told me he told that girl about me. I understand your concerns. But either you trust him or you suffer from your jalousy. The latter doesn't help at all in this situation.  Worse, it might turn your boyfriend off. He just wants to have a good trip and if this girl goes with him to this place, why not. You don't fall in love with every person you meet.

Try to feel compassion for him. His joy is your joy.

And if he betrays you, well, then he was the wrong one.

But don't let jalousy grow. It is very easy to do so. But it's one of the worst and most devastating feelings.

The theory of attachment with its different attachment styles might help you to see the situation from a wider angle. [Emotional Support]"
"My partner and I have been together for almost 4 years. We started dating in grade 10 and we are currently 2 years out of high school. We have lived together for the last 2 years of our relationship (he moved in with me). 

Every time I ask him to do something he either forgets or doesn’t do it properly. For example, today I went to work and he had the day off so I asked him to put a load of washing on (work clothes). I made sure to state that I needed work clothes for tomorrow. I come home and he onto put his work clothes onto wash leaving mine in the basket. When I asked him why mine weren’t put on he get extremely defensive and basically saying it’s ’not his fault’. He then ignores me to play his games etc. 

This isn’t the only time it’s like this though. He always forgets to do simple (everyday) chores that need to be done around the household and I am getting really exhausted from having to remind him everyday to do these simple tasks. He has been assigned one ‘main’ chore of taking the rubbish out at night but he even forgets that. Its really affected my feelings towards him because I feel like i’m ‘mothering’ him all the time.

I have spoken to him about these feelings on multiple occasions but he just says ‘sorry’ and he will do it next time…. but never does. 

I don’t know what to do anymore but I’m so tired of reminding him of his basic chores everyday and I’m also tired of being treated like i’m the ‘bad’ guy for constantly getting mad about it!  Why are you still with him? [Commentator's opinion]"
"I (25F) first said it doesn't matter cuz I'm tight anyway but he (28M) then asked what my preference is. I've seen his dick before, it's big, so I just said ""length"" but he isn't replying back now. Was I supposed to say something else?? It was a dumb question to ask if you're going to upset by the answer. One time a guy asked me what the biggest id has was and then got upset when he found out it was double his size. Don't ask then... 

There's no correct answer. If someone is insecure they shouldn't ask those questions. It does nothing because in healthy relationships you don't really care that much about what ""equipment"" your partner has you just learn to work with it because you care about eachother and want to make eachother happy.

"I had a pretty good date on Thursday. It was a little awkward at the end when we went to leave and we like didn’t kiss or anything and just kinda awkwardly waved goodbye. He texted me afterwards apologizing for the awkward goodbye and also told me he had a good time and wanted to see me this weekend. I responded that it was okay that it was awkward but I would definitely hangout with him this weekend. 

I haven’t heard anything back from him since I replied. I’m just confused why he asked to hang out if he didn’t really want to? Idk should I text him? HELP When someone suggests getting together, you must get into the habit of immediately replying ""Sounds great! Just tell me the day, time and place.""

"I want to know ur perspective on this. My partner wants marriage and kids with me and a house. We are currently at his place. I recently found an old notebook where he wrote love letters to his ex. He had written down, “Marry me one day” and goals about buying a house with her. The girl left him for a rich guy. Anyway, long story short, I realized he wants the same with me and it makes me feel a certain way that he basically asked his ex the same things. Should I be concerned? I know it wasn’t his fault in his last relationship but is this kinda sketch?  He has always mentioned he wants a life partner and is ready for marriage and kids. I guess I feel a little ….idk, like I’m just another girl he throws these words to. It is a big thing to want marriage with someone and I guess what I’m trying to ask is …”is he using this question loosely?” I am kinda a little hurt he already asked this big question to somebody (I know I know…I didn’t know him at the time and everybody has a past, but it kinda tugs at me)  He knows what he wants. A traditional life. The other girl left him for her own reasons.

"I am F (26) and my boyfriend is M (25). He is the kind of man out of a DREAM. He’s a provider, he pampers and spoils me, emotionally supports me, makes me feel like i’m a goddess. Everything has been great between us, and i could see myself spending my life with him. With all that being said, he admitted he was my STALKER before we met. 

This started when I found a reddit thread about a woman being stalked by her boyfriend prior to their relationship which sounded oddly familiar. i jokingly said that it reminded me of him, and playfully asked if he stalked me. he confessed that he had. 

he was designing a website for my employer, at the time i worked at a women’s clothing boutique. i modeled for the brand, which is where he found modeling photos of me, and admitted he couldn’t get me out of his head. he said my eyes in the photos felt like i was looking at him through the screen. he proceeded to go to the store where i worked, to find out my information from my coworker. 

he then proceeded to find my instagram, dive deeply into it, and then start to sit outside of the store to watch me. he said it was only a one time thing but i think he may be lying. 

there were other signs, like knowing information about me without me telling him, and his openness to confessing his deep obsession with me. he admitted he keeps a box under his bed with things he’s taken from me. small insignificant objects like used napkins, tissues, hair ties, etc, things that he keeps to remind himself of me.

i have to admit, i find this intriguing and almost charming, that he is so head over heels for me. i’m coming here to see if i’ve lost my mind for feeling this way? i also am a tiny bit creeped out, but i’m so in love it really overpowers that feeling. but how much of my love could potentially be manipulated? we’re best friends and i’ve never been happier.

"poly situationship 

so we are both in our early 20s and he has been in situationships before and was/is in one while we started talking and getting to know eachother. me? never. i’ve never even been in a relationship. he is interested in having a polygamous marriage in the future and also wants to explore himself sexually yet he has expressed he doesn’t want to lose me. at first i had considered the whole polygamous thing with him because i knew it would make him happy (mistake ik) but as time progressed i realized that this would make me incredibly unhappy. i feel like i lead him wrong in believing that i could live the future he wanted but that’s not really the issue. i love this boy and i’m pretty sure he loves me but i’m also very concerned about our future together. he’s expressed he isn’t sure he can be in a monogamous relationship bc of his finances but he recently went on a date with the girl he was in a situationship before before me (after telling me he was “finished with her” because he was really interested in me). the girl before me doesn’t want to be in a polygamist relationship either and doesn’t want to share him. i feel bad for the girl and feel bad for myself. he says that she’s leaving for medical school in the fall so i’d have his primary attention but that just feels wrong. 

my question is, am i being played or manipulated ? should i leave now before i get any more involved? or is he just a young man trying to figure his life out? sos🥲 Where the hell is your father? [Not Relevant]"
"This might be a stupid question, but talking to guys online/in dating apps it’s something I wonder. I know a lot of people are self conscious & might assume I’m being superficial & I don’t want to offend them. It doesn’t play a factor in if I’m interested in them but I will picture myself with the person throughout the day and I want to really be able to imagine would it would be like to lay/stand next to them, or to hug them. 
 The last guy I met with I truly thought he’d be much shorter than me from pictures but he was actually way taller and it was a bit intimidating being caught off guard lol. 


Edit: I will like him if he is short (like I imagine), I will like him if he is tall. I do not have a preference. Please stop trying to tell me what ~I~ like.

"My ‘31M’ boyfriend of 12 years is threatening to leave me ‘30 F’ if I buy a house of my own. He built a house for “us” on a 5 acre ranch. As kids I’d always tell him that it was my dream to have a ranch and he says that that’s why he built it. The house is almost done but it’s still in an unlivable condition. Since then we’ve stayed in his camper there on the property and he’s asked me to leave multiple times threatening to call the police on me for no reason just because he’s upset and doesn’t want to deal with me or my dog when it’s too hot. Because he’s done this to me multiple times and we need a place to live momentarily that has electricity I’ve considered buying a house instead of renting again. Because of this he’s threatening to leave me and has told me that he especially will if I continue to get too fat when I weight 130 lbs. and am 5’2 1/2. People say I look skinny. I am terrified of him leaving me when I’m older when I really don’t have a house to live at or when I truly can’t afford to buy one later on down the line when prices are even higher. 

Am I being unrealistic and selfish? He says I have this fake feministic way of thinking that the government tricked women into believing. He doesn’t want to marry me because he doesn’t want the government involved in our relationship. When I mention a prenup he says he doesn’t want to do that either because men always end up getting their assets taken away. I asked him to go half and half on payments and he doesn’t want that and I also asked him to put my name on his house deed that way I don’t risk him kicking me out randomly but he always says no. Instead he suggests I get a mortgage loan under my name to buy off his property off of him that way he can get more money to finish building the house and that way the loan is under my name. 

What would you do?
He says that if he was going to leave me, he would’ve already left me a long time ago because we’ve been together for so many years and he hasn’t yet.

"i don’t have anyone else to go to, please be kind as i’m hurting a lot. 

FYI he’s a very straightforward, blunt, and honest man. please don’t tell me he’s playing me, cheating, or there’s another girl. it’s not like that all, and i’m very sure he’s in love with me and cares about me. it’s just that he’s had very very bad experiences in the past, and in the beginning of our relationship it was quite rocky but we got through it. 

long story short, i snapped at him for the first time, got angry. i understood i shouldn’t have, but he overreacted.

he ignored me for 6 hours that day, then proceeded to tell me we’ll talk tomorrow about it. i got really upset, and tried to communicate with him. but he shut me out, and went to sleep. 

the next morning, he broke up with me over text, which is not like him AT ALL. i then tried to communicate with him, but he kept shutting me out until eventually he blocked me for 10 minutes, then unblocked me and said “let’s call tonight, but we’re not getting back together, just for what it’s worth. i’m sorry i didn’t communicate with you properly”

i agreed to the call. but we ended up never calling. i sent him a long text, being as mature and honest as possible.

the next day he apologized for his immature behavior, and agreed to my suggestion of going on a 3 week break rather than breaking up to clear our minds, however he told me that he thinks he’s not ready for a relationship and will use this time to think about it seriously. 

it’s been a few days. and i’m thinking of texting him because i think a 3 week break over this matter isn’t the right choice. i really wanna worn things out with him and i wanna fix everything.  he’s backed out before but he came back.

now i’m wondering, what should i do? continue this 3 week break? text him in a week? i don’t understand i’m confused and hurt and i don’t want to give up on him. 

TLDR; Bf got trauma triggered after me getting angry at him for the first time, now he’s suddenly backed out of the relationship.  Can you tell us anything about what exactly happened in the moment that triggered him?

I’d also move on. Something doesn’t add up. [Practical Advice]"
"
I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for about a year, and was friends with her for a couple years before that too. Things have been generally very good until recently. When she asked me if I watch porn, my answer was yes. There was never any boundary set where either of us couldn't watch porn in our relationship, but she doesn't and assumed I didn't either. She was very hurt by my answer and said it made her feel like she wasn't good enough, but I really just use porn casually once or twice a week. It's not about comparing her to any other women from my perspective, but I also understand her point of view. I feel really bad about saying this but the weight she has put on since we started dating has really made me much less attracted to her, but I only noticed that once she threatened to break up with me unless I stopped watching porn. Everything was fine until then, when she didn't know I was watching porn I was completely satisfied sexually and she wasn't hurt. In all other ways she is very good to me and we really get along. She has a great sense of humor and is great to be around, but I feel that my physical attraction to her might just not be there anymore. I feel like a total pig actually saying this but also attraction is one of the basic foundations of a relationship. I'm not happy where we are right now and something needs to change or there's no point in commiting any further. Do I have to confront her about her weight? I don't think it's right to make her change just because of me, because she is who she is and we just might not be the right match. Just writing this has made everything much clearer, but what do you even say to someone in this situation? I don't want to hurt her.  2 things here 
1) Ask her if she’s ok. Yes people’s bodies change but there might also be some other factors you don’t know about. 
2) Look at your last 4 sentences. Do you confront her, make her change, say to someone. When people type these things their word choices can reveal things about them. You’ve singled this out to it her problem, but is it? 

In your own words you noticed she had put on weight but it didn’t hit you until she created a boundary that you don’t like, stop watching porn. Now it’s an issue you are thinking about confronting her about. If you don’t want to hurt her break things off tell her “I don’t see this going any further and we both deserve better.” It will hurt at first but it’s much better than saying “you put on weight and I’m not into that”.

So we have been dating a little over 6 months and because of our jobs we don’t see each other very often. She has mainly guy friends and we have been getting in arguments over her wanting to go and stay in Airbnbs with 3 other guys over the weekend. I am uncomfortable with this even though I fully trust her but one of the dudes previously liked her and another borderline sexually harassed her before (so mush so that her work place is aware of it) and she agrees not to go but will wake the weekend after the next and it’s been like this a couple weeks now and idk what to do. I feel like I’m cutting her off from friends but at the same time it makes me uncomfortable. This is just one of the issues that we’ve been having and I just wanted opinions on it I don't think you're being controlling [Commentator's opinion]
"So I (21F) have been in a relationship for a couple of months but it was not it for me, I felt nothing, just hurt by his (21M) actions (or lack of them) and I communicated it to him and he said he won't change so I broke up with him. Now I'm trying to date, but the thing is that I literally feel nothing. I want to feel, but it's not there. Guys tell me I'm so nice and funny and then make jokes that make me feel inferior and it's all gone, I try to tell them that it is an issue for me and they tell me something like (it's just a joke) but it's not. Those things get to me, I've been told my whole life that I'm not enough or will never amount to anything. I am in therapy, doing my best and it's still not enough to be talked to like I'm an equal and not someone stupid. Like, am I smiling too much? Do I look like I'm stupid or act like it? It's just exhausting, I don't know what to do. Am I supposed to just wait? Am I the problem?   Alpha widowed & can’t pair bond. Most common problem these days. That’s what happens when women confuse sexual attention with desire to commit. [Commentator's opinion]"
"So my girlfriend and I have been dating for about 9 months and I'm not sure how to tell her I get frustrated at some of the questions she asks me because my emotions are not complex enough to handle them. For example: Sometimes she will ask me how I am feeling or what I am thinking about. I didn't have a problem answering in the past but over the course of our relationship I've learned that certain answers will trigger follow up questions that I was not prepared to answer or have no desire to answer - especially if there was a specific thing recently affecting me.
She will ask ""How are you feeling?"" and if I answer ""I'm feeling pretty good."" Her follow-up response/question would be ""Even though your stomach was hurting earlier?"". A question like that will take me away from the current, positive feeling I have and bring me back to how I was feeling when my stomach was upset. After that, I feel my emotions are too simple to take me back to where I was after being reminded of a negative experience and I am left with a feeling of frustration towards my girlfriend for that being a follow up question.

I'm not sure how to address with her without making her feel she shouldn't ask me questions or get to know me. Any advice on how to bring it up to her or ways I cannot be so affected by her questions? She isn't sensitive in general but she is more sensitive to the things I say and how I say them. Does she think you were worried or upset earlier because you had a stomach ache? Some peoples emotions show up physically.

Do you want to get more in touch with your emotions? Ask her if her stomach hurts when she is upset. Or idk, have this conversation you posted with her. [Practical Advice]"
"aka he's cheating but only the girl finishes and he did not? is that even realistically speaking, possible? or he's lying? but why would he lie about something like that? He already admitted that he cheated on me, why tell me that detail? And another thing, when we were still getting to know each other, he told me that his first ex cheated on him multiple times during their long-term rs so this made me wonder the fuck out, IF U ALREADY EXPERIENCED BEING CHEATED ON, WHY WOULD U DO IT TO UR PARTNER IF U SAID U ALREADY KNOW THE FEELING OF IT AND ITS NOT GOOD???
He also told me when he admitted that he cheated the day after he had done the deed that if he was on my shoes, he would immediately leave me and i told him ""well the thing is, ITS NOT U WHO GOT CHEATED ON SO U DONT GET TO QUESTION HOW I WILL HANDLE MY BUSINESS OF GETTING CHEATED ON"" sorry for the capital letters, noni did not yell at him, i just want to emphasize it so that it gets through his closed minded head at the time. Like why would u compare ur experience with mine when we are not the same person, every person is different so do not assume that if something happens and ur action works with it, it doesn't mean that it will work with mine. And call me all u want y'all but I was willing to talk things between us, I was willing to hear him out and make him do the consequences of his actions but he said he will choose to distance himself from me because I do not deserve something horrible like him, who cheated on me. Oops, kinda got sidetracked but any inputs about my question and our situation, everyone? I will appreciate it! LOL. This is a wild lie. The boys are getting sillier aren’t they?

"Got tested a couple of months ago after returning from South Africa, per a promise to my partner then . She and I are on good terms but are no longer dating. My test was clean. Fyi I have been polyamorous for years now.

Since returning, I have had sex with her and 3 other people, 2 new. With one of these people, the condom slipped at the end. I told her I was fine with being tested, which she liked, and I feel is the right thing to do.

She has since mostly vanished, just exhibiting breadcruming. I understand she has a life and that despite really connecting, that doesn't mean a fling necessitates more from either party. She is not responding to texts or asking for me to get tested, so I've moved along in life whilst enjoying a good memory.

I get tested annually, at least, and am not worried. But out of respect for her, I am fine with getting tested. FYI I have had a vasectomy so that isn't a concern.

Tldr; for someone who has clearly moved along and is not keeping in touch, should I get tested after a condom briefly slipped? FYI this is one of those condom slipped off while pulling out after orgasm, not mid-sex.

Please, I've had a tough month so save any aggressive comments for elsewhere. I'm trying to do the right thing. Get tested for you not her. [Practical Advice]"

"This is so stupid compared to all the other posts in here but I just genuinely don’t know what to do. 

For context, we were in a 8 month talking stage & he asked me out right before my girls trip to DR in March, however we made it clear that we were only talking to each other prior to dating. 

In January, I found out he was messaging this girl he had a previous fling with last year. I asked him about it and he said he was just asking her to get his speaker back. Then I dropped it. 

My boyfriend is a well known guy in our city, & he’s attractive. He gets a lot of attention from other girls, he follows some attractive girls, but I never cared because he gave me a sense of stability. I don’t care when he goes out with his friends, simply because I trust him, but now I don’t. 

Recently I saw screenshots of the conversation (friend showed me), he was asking to see her, was saying she’s looking good- basically pursuing her. 

We had a conversation about it, he apologized about it. I felt stable in my relationship with him up until this point, I hate being lied to. He said he didn’t hang out w her, then said he went to pick up his speaker & she just gave it to him while he was in his car- but I kind of don’t really believe that at all

I know we weren’t dating, but exclusivity was established by this time. Even though it happened in the past, I don’t know how to bring it up with him & get the truth out. I feel like he may be lying, but I don’t want to continue badgering him about this if he is telling the truth. 

I know this is so stupid, I just feel so overwhelmed so I turned to reddit for help lol  Reflect on Your Feelings: It's important to acknowledge how you feel about the situation. Trust your instincts and recognize that your feelings are valid. [Practical Advice]"
"I am looking to getting to really fix my dating life. However, the major essence of this is not to be in a committed relationship but to be a fuck boy or a player. I dont have a lot of experience so I want to build that up before actually deciding to commit or get married. Been working on myself constantly for the past year. I moved countries. Got a high paying job and lost weight. I was 120kg but i weigh 95 now. I dont have abs yet but I should probably start seeing them by year end. I was only doing cardio cause I was broke and had no money to pay for a gym but I can now afford to pay for a gym so I am joining one and I am going to be consistent.

However, I dont want to wait till I get abs to really fix my dating. I have only had one gf and not much experience and I am bald and black and I am wondering if its possible to achieve what I want. I am also over 6 feet tool if that helps. I was also thinking getting tattoos and piercings if they would help but the fact I am bald and I cant get those nice black guys haircut or dreads or the black panther villain guy haircut tells me it might be a waste.

How can I genuinely do this. I dont mind dedicating 6 months to a year to achieve this. I am a patient man. Getting that fuckboy status will not fulfill any type of happiness.  You'll probably get a std also with the process.  Why not just start up dating when you get the body you're trying to achieve?  A fuckboy is just an asshole with a bad reputation that others will know of later. [Commentator's opinion]"
"We have been dating for a year. I went to visit him last week before he moved back to his parents’ house from college. He was affectionate and gave me advice on an argument I had with my family. 

Then he didn’t respond for days and I panicked because I thought he was depressed and blocking me out or mad at me. He later told me his phone was acting up and he didn’t receive my messages. What’s more, he made a new instagram account and was posting there and adding people while he wasn’t in contact with me. It left a bad taste in my mouth because I thought he was ghosting me and he always told me how much he hated people showing off on social media. He explained that he just wanted to share his hobbies and life with others. 

I expected things to go back to normal after that. But since he moved back a few days ago, he’s been even worse at responding. One word responses without the pet names, emotes or punctuation he usually uses. I told him he sounded cold and asked if he could tell me he missed me and loved me like usual (because he wasn’t saying it back) and he barely responded and said he’s been out of it recently. It feels like I’m pulling teeth talking to him, and yet he’s more active on all his social media platforms than ever.

Maybe he just needs time to recharge, so should I just stop bothering him with texts for a bit? It upset me because if I’m active online but wanting to work on something I’ll tell him “hey, i’m going to work on this” instead of replying one word and leaving him hanging. I would like to think he’s just going through it or busy and overwhelmed right now, but any text conversation with him (can’t get him to call for the life of me) reinforces his reluctance to express any affection. I wish he would open up to me like he said he could if he is stressed out or something. Right now it just seems like everything I say is bothering him. 



 Time to take a step back and stop reaching out to him. The more you try to engage him, the more he's going to distance himself. He knows how to reach you if he wants to invest himself in the relationship. You want someone who wants to invest themselves in you and the relationship. He's not showing he is.

"I (F24) don't know what to do with dating. I've been single my entire life and I haven't had sex or kissed anyone ever. I know I am sexually attracted to men and women, I think I am mostly physically attracted to men but romantically to women. This makes it very hard for me to know what's best for me. I don't feel comfortable with having sex before a few months of dating. I am scared that when I start dating one gender over the other I will feel in doubt all the time because I haven't experienced the other gender.

Does anyone have any advice for me? Icy\_Peach9128 wrote the best advice so far. Focus on the individual in front of you, and go from there. In reference to other comments, I also will say that there is *absolutely no necessity* to pursue ""open relationships"" or ""threesomes."" 

You should never feel guilt or ""doubt"" if you date one gender and ""haven't experienced the other gender."" Plenty of straight people are virgins for *decades*, but they know they are straight. You above all know your heart, and only you know who you're attracted to.

Nonetheless, it sounds like you're still trying to figure certain things out. If you're looking for advice, it should probably be from other people who are bisexual or the like. Learning their stories -- even if only through podcasts, essays, etc -- can illuminating. They may or may not be role models for you. Indeed, you might look at an individual and go, ""Oh, Lord, this person is weird and their dating style sucks."" But either way, they can serve as clear foils for the person you want to become. 

Best of luck! [Practical Advice]"
"Idk if it’s just me but I’m 20 and every now and then I get a match in the app but literally 9/10 times there’s no response or anything like they just swipe the profile or sum but past that, do women see men with tinder or other dating apps as a red flag for using/having? Most women men are looking for on there are bots or scams. 
 People who no longer use the app would probably say it's a red flag. 
Men have said they swipe right on all since the odds of actually meeting someone is low.
Women have more vetting to do. 

A lot still use the app but some (including me) don't and think it's not going to help or get you what you are actually looking for. [Commentator's opinion]"
"We've been together for a year almost, more often than not I always initiate. We see each other 2-3 times a week, but mainly to do sports or activities, maybe once we will stay over in each other place and most of the time I'm the one engaging sex?

I have mentioned this to him and he understands my frustration he says, he says he likes me a lot, and he fancies me, says I'm good looking/attractive and fit, so physical appearance should not be an issue, I'm his type?

Now he keeps telling me that he has low libido, yet he watches porn everyday, he sex talks a lot and online is more ""playful"" than me.

For example, last wednesday he stayed over at mine, and I initiated and we had sex (last time had been over a week), then on friday we met again and he stayed over, I tried to initiate (again) and he said he was too tired, even to cuddle or kiss, in which I understood, people have those moments. So in the morning I tried to be fun and started caressing him and see his mood, and he was like ""I haven't brushed my teeth"", ""I want to sleep"" this was at 10:00 am.

I'm getting to a point where I'm not sure anymore, I'm trying to abstain from bad thoughts, I really like this guy but I'm starting to feel like a needy person when I'm with him? It's getting to a point I'm not wanting to initiate anymore and if I do it just means we will have less sex. Next time I'm seeing him will be this friday and I know that more than likely we will have because he asked for me to stay over, but I feel so frustrated that I feel like going, staying but just not do anything, but that's not a healthy approach or thought...

TDLR : I feel like I'm being needy, I communicate as much as I can with my partner but I'm just feeling like shit and the only one that cares about this... Maybe the things you two like sex wise are different and he doesn't feel motivated. Do you know what type of porn he watches or does the sex talk involve anything paticular that could might hint about his interests and likes about sex.

Now to the honest part;

>We see each other 2-3 times a week, but mainly to do sports or activities, maybe once we will stay over in each other place and most of the time I'm the one engaging sex?

>he says he likes me a lot, and he fancies me

>even to cuddle or kiss

This this doesn't sound like a relationship. It sound like a long-term FWB thing. It's very unlikely for someone to just hang around to do sports and activities, to say they like you or fancy you (not love you after almost a year), and be so cold not to cuddle for even 5 minutes and be dismissive in the morning, and see this a serious relationship. He seems to be dragging you along for his benefit. [Commentator's opinion]"
"Had a guy slide into my dm yesterday. He's been filling me for a while and loves what I post and says he wants to be friends. After an hour of dm I fall asleep and he tells me to text him in the morning and sends his number. 

Super nice, sweet and attentive asks me lots of questions and such. And I haven't seen a red flag yet. 

I'm unsure if he actually wants to be friends and keep texting or if he's actually into me? This has just never happened before. 

Like one time via dm- a guy was like I manifest you everyday and I blocked him. haha like do not manifest me into your life!

Anyways idk should I be weary? Get his number and call a few times. Beats the hell out of phone tag with texts [Practical Advice]"
"M29 and f28 meet on dating app nearly two months ago. Instant hit it off and she even stayed at my house for nearly a week once. Hiking, bars, grilling, nature, etc etc all fun activities and such.

Im renovating a house and want to get it done before summer is over. I also want to hang out with the boys, we exchange actual skills and knowledge like carpentry, construction, electrical etc. 

Just so happened (m&f) we  didn't meet for like a week partly due to us living 2.5 hrs apart and because I had a friend stay over for 5 days to help with the house work. Morning to night honest work.

Anyway, was talking to girl, she first hung out with some ""girl"" she says who had a bmw m6 and met at the vet when her cat had to be looked at. Then a few days after she met up with some guy nearly 2 hrs from her to go eat steak and lobster at a restaurant. She said ""I was really hungry and had no money but I swear I left immediately after we finished eating"". Keep in mind I personally cut communication with other women during  our time of dating. She's entertaining God knows how many other people, that's just two cases she told me about, And I insinctively knew something was up when she said she was going to ""x neighborhood"" without saying why exactly (initially). All this she while simultaneously claiming to love me and be obsessed with me.

 Anyway bros (and ladies), I'm too old for childish bs and unrealistic demands for attention. Your thoughts are appreciated, thanks. You're not enough for her. You're plan B.


She gives you enough to keep you interested while exploring better options. If they don't pan out, you'll be there crying and begging. She knows you're a simp and will never cut her off, do she can do whatever she likes.

"I (23NB) met my now girlfriend (22F) about a year ago. We took a community college summer class together and became very fast friends. There was obviously an instant attraction as well, which we discussed, but she told me she was working on her mental health and wasn't ready to be in a relationship at the moment. I was relieved because I was in a similar situation. We stayed friends for about 6 weeks before she told me she didn't want to wait anymore and that she wanted to pursue a relationship with me. Stupidly, I said yes. The first few months of our relationship were great, I truly fell in love with her. However, as it continued it became glaringly obvious how much we both really were not ready to be in a relationship. I am currently working very hard to improve my mental health, but my girlfriend doesn't seem nearly as interested in recovery as before. She keeps insisting that she'll start going to therapy regularly, looking for a job, etc. but she never does. She spends all of her time hanging out with me/trying to hang out with me or binging TV shows. I genuinely don't think this relationship is good for her, however, she frequently expresses how much our relationship has helped her, and how she knows she'll be okay as long as we're together. I know this all could have been avoided if I hadn't agreed to a relationship with her, and instead continued to be her friend. I don't want to cut contact with her, because I really do love her, but I don't know if I can stay in this relationship anymore and I feel like this will break her. What should I do?

TLDR; I rushed into a relationship with my girlfriend and now I don't feel like I can break up with her.  People fall in and out of love, you are not a bad person for not loving her anymore. That doesn’t mean also that it was a mistake to get into a relationship with her. You followed your heart and it’s okay.

Just be honest with her. It was good while it lasted and relationships come to an end, sometimes way earlier than one would want or expect, but it happens.

Also, assure her that she will be fine without you too. Everything is always fine in the end. The sun always shine after the storm, it’s cliché but true. [Practical Advice]"
"Pretty much as the title says, I just have a hard time telling between the two especially when there are mixed signals. Any advice would be appreciated! Well, what are the signals? Not enough detail. I know people that mistake friendliness for crushing, despite obvious signs they’re not interested. Like guys who go to a restaurant and think every waitress wants it because she’s doing her job and being friendly lol. I also know some people play hard to get. That’s usually obvious to me though. Without any details, can’t say. But more often than not- mixed signals aren’t a good sign. Them not wanting a relationship with you doesn’t mean they should be mean or cold. Some people are just nice. 

You can ask them if they’d be interested in a date. If you’re not confident enough for that and want to be ‘sure’ first- Maybe try distancing yourself. If he/she makes an effort to check in, then go from there. [Practical Advice]"
"Hi I need your help.  
3 months ago I (33F) met someone with whom I want to be(34M). Everyone around says we're a perfect couple destine to be together. Our relationship has been fantastic. We love spending time together and having fun, find each other super attractive, and care for and support one another. He even asked for my picture to keep in his wallet and introduced me to his important friends and family.

However, there's a problem. Yesterday, he told me he only sometimes feels butterflies for me. He doesn't want to break up but also can't see us together because of the missing butterflies. He said everything else is wonderful—we're amazing together, he misses me, and he longs to see me often. All the bases of our relationship are solid except for that emotional spark. He blames himself, saying he's broken and it's not my fault. He wanted me to come up with a solution, but I have none.

I'm awful at love games... I'm good at flirting and the pre-couple stage, but when I'm in a relationship, I don't know how to keep things going. I care deeply about the other person and am probably too straightforward, showing all my cards.

He also told me that, in his opinion, I have two options: we either become friends or I break up with him. But when I suggested breaking up, he didn't want it, which left me confused. He couldn't understand how I could just leave him after three months together, and I got even more puzzled. He asked me what I feel towards him and what are my future plans. After hearing all the things, I got blocked and couldn't admit he's dear to me. I only respond I cares about him, he's important and that I would like to have family as he know, but I don't know if I would have a chance, because such important decision also depends on the partner and I don't know if the other side would like to have kids.

Today he texted to me, that he wants me to remember I'm important to him. He asked how do I feel and ask if he can do anything to make me feel better.

This message upset me a lot, because only what I want it's him. But as he said, he cannot be with me without butterflies....on the other hand he doesn't want to break-up because what is between us means a lot to him and he cares about me.  
I don't know what to answer... I don't know how repair this situation... They’re not butterflies, it’s anxiety. And he’s not got it because this isn’t toxic. If he reflects it’s likely that he’s only had those butterflies when it’s been lust based and at least slightly toxic and unhealthy.  [Commentator's opinion]"
"I've been dating this girl for 3 months now. She's always been my all time crush/type. We have different lifestyles; she enjoys parting and drinking which I don't. She’s passionate about everything. Last week, her period came 11 days early, which is unusual for her. I suspect she might have taken Plan B (the morning-after pill) because her cycle has always been regular. This made me worried since we didn't mess but all she did was take a pregnancy test. It's shaken my trust. I'm tempted to check her phone something I know I’ll find the truth. when we are together she doesn't pick up  some calls something that I'm suspicious about. You’ll suggest I have a deep conversation with her but it will lead to her gaslighting me. However, I'm ready to face the reality (requesting her phone), whatever it may be. Please leave her the hell alone. You are almost 30 years old and acting far younger than she is [Hurtful]"

So basically, I (16M) just got a gf, I am super in love and I think its working. When the summer ends and school starts the daughter of my parents’ friends from the other side of the country will come to live with us for the whole school year. She is a year older and I have zero interest, I agreed to this about 8 months ago and I didn’t have a gf. I need to tell my gf asap and I don’t know how and I don’t know if its gonna be a big deal. I might be the issue here but I feel like if a guy that I didn’t know came to live with her for a full year i’d be super uncomfortable. Idk. Need help. I told my parents and they could not care less.

"Went on a really random tinder date while out of town. Completely last minute, but actually had a great time! Went to her house, did a puzzle together, talked about some deep topics, actually had a lot in common. Super cute and sweet girl. Ended with cuddling and making out while watching a movie together. Didn't sleep with her, but we were deff into eachother (attleast in the moment). Texted her the next day saying I had a great time, she responded saying same, nice meeting you, with a smiley.  Texted her the next day, no answer, so I decided to just give her some space. I didn't have her # but I did still have her address. Felt ambitious so I just said fuck it and ordered her another puzzle delivered to her house,  with a hint of who it was from without giving my name, kind of an Inside joke lol. Is that creepy? It got to her house yestueday and still haven't heard from her. Only reason I even bothered is because  this was the first date I've been on in a while that I actually felt that I liked the person afterward. One thought is that maybe she was turned off that I'm not in the same city as her? No idea. I'm sure the move I made was unorthodox, but is it creepy? Thoughts?

"A few days ago, I met this girl IRL. We only knew each other by sight, as she's friends with some of my friends and came along with them to hang out. We ended up having a normal, friendly chat that night. A few hours after we parted ways, she sent me a follow request on Instagram. I accepted and followed her back. I know people following each other on social media after meeting is normal, but I had a feeling something was coming... I was right.

The next day, she sent me a DM. She wanted to share something related to our conversation from the night before and wanted my opinion on it. She had a video to share, but it was too long to send on Instagram, so she asked for my number to send it (I knew this was the “perfect setup” for her to talk to me more). Now, this would have been fine if I had any real interest in her, but I don't. I hate giving false hopes and feeding conversations with girls I'm not interested in (relationship-wise). I know some guys like the attention, but I genuinely hate playing with someone's feelings and emotions, so I always avoid stretching conversations for too long.

Well, we ended up texting a bit that day because I wanted to help her out and be nice. But the conversation dragged on, and I got the feeling she was interested in me, even though neither of us flirted or she said anything explicit that said so. I waited for it to become a bit “dry” and stopped responding. She texted me again the next day. We talked a bit, and when the conversation was winding down, she left me with a “tell me more about you.” At that moment, I knew I was in trouble and didn't know what to do. I didn't want to ghost her or be rude, so I kept the conversation going one more time.

Like I said, this isn't the first time I've been in a situation where I feel ""trapped"" in a conversation with a girl. Usually, they give up when the convo becomes ""dead,"" but once, I gave too much attention and the girl ended up getting hurt. I don't want that to happen again. 

Almost a week has passed since we first met, and she keeps texting me, even when I don't respond for almost a full day or leave dry messages. She's not annoying, and the topics she brings up aren't boring or forced. I enjoy talking to her and she is genuinely a nice person, but I don't want her to develop strong feelings for me. Maybe she just wants a friend and I don´t mind being friends with her, but that's it.

Please, help me. How do I get out of a situation like this? This part;

“Maybe she just wants a friend and I don´t mind being friends with her, but that's it.”

Lay out your intentions, be direct. This can be done tastefully, but sounds like she needs to understand there’s nothing more.. which many people won’t unless they are told. 

It does sound like she’s interested & if/when you advise her that you legit don’t want anything more than friends she may completely back off.. if nothing else she’ll know where you stand. [Practical Advice]"
"For context, I am very understanding about mental health. I have had my fair share of depression and anxiety in my past and have been very supportive about his struggles our whole relationship. 
We have been together for 6 years and he was struggling with his depression from the start (well since he was a teenager but I knew when we got together). I love him with all my heart and can’t wait to marry him, but his mental health never seems to improve and I’m struggling to mentally support him all the time. 
We have countless conversations about him seeking help and changing his medication (he has sought help on and off for years) and how it effects our lives.  But it feels like we are just going in circles. He may go see a doctor or psyc but doesn’t maintain this and just stop when he feels he is okay in himself, then he goes down hill again. 
I work 7 days a week to try and pay for our upcoming wedding and do have a lot of pressures in my own life, then coming home to find him in the same spot when I left after being home all day, just leaves me to pick up everything (cleaning, cooking, bills, etc). He works long hours himself so I do understand to a point but everything seems to fall back on me-leaving me exhausted and drained everyday.
Our sex life has taken a massive hit. I have a high sex drive but also place intimacy quite highly in importance to me. He never seems to want to do anything with me and will just sleep or distract himself with other hobbies, making me very self conscious about myself. 
I understand the effects of depression on someone’s life, but now I myself am struggling with everything. 
We have big in-depth talks and he promises to help himself but we always end up back where we started. 

What do I do? Any advice? 
Thx  OP. 

Let's take you out of the box which is your life right now, and have you stand outside of it looking in. 

You have a wedding coming up. 

This should be the happiest time of your life right now. 

Sex has dried up. 

Your mental health is starting to suffer. 

You're carrying all this weight because your partner is suffering for mental health issues.. 

He's going off and on with meds and help, it's a never ending cycle..


How are you going to be a mom through all this? 

How are your kids going to be through all this? 

Are they going to have mental health issues too? 

How is he going to be a father through all this? 

You're already holding up a household by yourself right now. Now imagine doing that with a husband and kids. Can you handle all that weight? 

Right now your faced with a difficult situation. Stay or go.  

If I were you, I would postpone the wedding. 

Take a step back for you and your mental health. 

If you proceed with marrying him, one day your knees are going to buckle under the immense weight.  

If he can't help himself now, nothing else is going to fix it. 

Are you even getting therapy for all this? 

Right now, you should be smiling and happy! Planning your wedding! But you sound depressed you sound like you're turning into him.

"I met someone via an app (Feeld, if it matters), who seemed interesting and interested, as we maintained conversation for a number of days consecutively. One day, a couple of weeks ago, she sent an unusually terse reply inquiring as to what could account for my writing style, which I admit can be rather stilted and pedantic (I, unfortunately, have ASD, and it has been a thorn in my side socially for almost as long as I can remember). I was frank about it, and she didn't seem deterred. In fact, she suggested we call on the phone at some point, and asked for my number. I gave it to her, and she curiously seemed to go MIA. 

I sent a follow-up, to no avail, a few days later, and a few days after that a message that, politely and reasonably (in my opinion, anyway), inquired as to whether she would like to remain in contact. She replied within a day, apologizing for her taciturnity and relating that life had become unaccountably all-consuming due to her being a student. She reiterated a desire to call sometime. I acknowledged the message, and reiterated that there was no pressure, that she could reconnect when the demands upon her returned to normal. That was approximately two weeks ago.

I fear that I am being naive in supposing that she's been so swamped for so long that she could not reply even intermittently and briefly. My initial suspicion was that she was someone operating behind a false front collecting numbers for whatever purpose, but I'm now convinced I came off as undesirable and she didn't/doesn't want to directly convey this.

Anyhow, is waiting any further in vain? Thanks. Meh, no point in waiting on an inconsistent maybe. No need to block her, just chalk it up as a matter of differences or life or whatever helps you forget about it and continue living your life. If she reaches out again, respond appropriately. If not, oh well, you won't have been thinking about it anyway. 

No need to think about her any further. Just enjoy your life and carry on, my friend! [Practical Advice]"
"my bf and I are long distance for the time being as we go to the same area around college, but we are currently 13 hours apart timezone-wise. i really enjoy spending time together as we share the same academic interests and hobbies, we called everyday for 1-3 hours (barring things like seeing family or doing other activities/obligations of course) but now he feels the calling has been too much for his social battery. i feel a bit conflicted because i found it perfect as he makes my evenings brighter even with so much on my plate. i want to call everyday, and i enjoy it into my daily routine. i have a tendency to need things to be the same everyday, and if things dont play out as scheduled, i get so stressed. i understand this is an unhealthy habit of mine, so i try not to let that affect a relationship, but i want to be with someone that calls me everyday instead of texting me because texts (for me) aren’t a reliable source of emotional support or connection. in almost everything else, we are so compatible. but im having trouble finding the warmth or connection to him if we were to do this routine. 

 That’s too much for a majority of men imo. Cut it down to a 2-3 times a week and see how it goes. You can convince him to keep doing it but his feelings won’t change and could become something that pushes him away. 

If breaking the routine impacts you that much it’s on you to solve it, not your BF becoming a crunch. [Practical Advice]"
"I (28M) matched a girl on Hinge and we hit things off. We arranged a date for a weeks time but I said let's get a brief call in before then (it's something I do as a pre-screen before I commit a whole evening to someone). We were set to have the call and she replied the night before and the morning of, then stopped messaging around 1pm - I had no inclination to think she wouldn't follow through with the call.

I'm a super busy person and value time, so not only do I not like wasting my own time but I treat other people's time with exactly the same level of respect as I do my own (just to be clear). So when it got to the evening and she never replied (even after a nudge text at 6pm) I was pretty pissed off. I had come home specifically to chat to her and cut other commitments short to accomadate her.

I ended up sending her a message the following afternoon saying roughly: 'I would have appreciated a text as I had put aside time in my evening to speak to you. This isn't the most considerate behaviour I've seen and not a cute look, you came across as someone who I thought would have better manners than this but I guess I was wrong"".

Granted it was a a slightly 'sharp' response, but I don't think it was out of pocket when I sent it. She responded saying I should be more considerate of what other's are going through and that my default reaction should be kindness..... but shouldn't her advice include taking the 5 seconds to text that they can't make time for the call? - I feel like she just wanted to gaslight me and avoid accountability.

I'm finding this behaviour more and more common, so have been feeling more inclined to call the behaviour out. Ghosting by definition is psychopathic and I'm really tired of it being an acceptable norm and genuinely want to start biting back instead of just letting things slide - people are too detached from what a scummy thing to do it really is. What are people's thoughts on sending messages like these when someone acts in these disregarding ways? NTA but also, you think she cares? Your text has had no impact on her.  If I ghosted someone, your text really would have made me lol.  So from her perspective, the ghosting was totally worth it.  [Commentator's opinion]"

"I went on one date with a guy I matched with on hinge. We spoke for about a week or more before actually meeting. I thought he was a really nice person and all, but I wasn't physically attracted to him. But I would feel bad about ending it (and also don't know how to go about that because I'm soft AF and feel bad about anything and everything) because there's no red flags or reason to do so.
I feel like I'm just being shallow for not being physically attracted to him because his personality is great. 
I'm new to dating so don't quite understand the whole chemistry thing- I've been only on one date prior to this man and didn't feel anything either times. But both were nice so idk what I'm looking for.

But with the current guy I'm dating, when we message he kinda talks about 'next time', and to me it's like, you don't know if there will be a next time. Would you consider that a red flag that he low key plans for future dates? He done this before we even initially met. We agreed to meet at a park and he said something like next time we can do an activity. Idk I just don't like it but again am I being harsh?

I feel like I'm not made for dating and just want to stop with these apps, but I have no way of letting him go gently. I considered just deleting my profile, but that's so rude because he's actually a nice guy. But I also don't want to be leading him on. He's asked me out for dinner, he's a nice guy, but I'd feel bad letting him spend his money on me when I'm so unsure if I want to continue with him. Please help because I'm supposedly seeing him tonight/tomorrow and idk what to think or feel!

In summary: idk if I should stop dating simply because I'm not finding him physically attractive?  He's talking about future plans because he likes you. That's called asking a girl out. 😉

If you aren't into him, then follow this script via text before your second date:

""Hey Joe, thanks again for hanging out the other day. I had a great time! You are a very nice guy!

Unfortunately, I don't think we're a romantic match. 

I think you are a great person, and I'm really glad we were able to meet in person.

All the best""

Then, unmatch on the dating app and move on. [Practical Advice]"
"
My girlfriend and I were in a 6 years relationship, almost 7, for educational reasons some of these were ldr and we discussed this before me moving abroad.

Well last year I decided to move back to my home country to move in together with her. A few days after arriving I was looking through her phone's gallery, obligatory not spying, I was in bed she was playing something, and noticed a sexual Instagram reel recorded, at first I didn't think much about it but then I was like ""haven't seen this one"" and I confronted her about, she started making excuses, but after some talking she said she was talking with another dude on discord for a few months now, everytime she told me she was going to sleep she would just call him or whatever, not long after starting speaking with said dude they started sexting (pics included), due to the nature of the job I was applying to I couldn't focus on this issue and things continued as normal until a few months later I started resenting here, borderline hating, and I decided to break up with her, well after some talking and each one of us moving back with our parents we decided to try a psychologist alone and couple therapy where we decided to try to work on things but not meaning we will remain together 100%.


Fast forward to this week we broke up, I did, because for a few months now neither of us was happy, we were fighting a lot and things were just not working, I wasn't seeing a future with her.

My question is, did I make the right choice or not? Reasons.

Before asking, yes I was 100% faithful, didn't have much free time (working, studying and going to the gym), but all my free time was spent with her.

You can ask more questions won't add more in the post.

TL:DR girlfriend started sexting with some dude, we tried to work on our relationship for a year, but it was going nowhere so I decided to break up.

Thanks. It sounds like you made a good decision, yeah. 

Much love bro [Emotional Support]"
"Age gap couple… advice please

Hello, so I rarely if ever post but need some advice. 
I met a man who is 14 years my senior (28f and 42m). We started talking and absolutely hit it off about 4 months ago after knowing each other since the last 2 years under other circumstances. We currently are long distance as we met while I was traveling for work. We have spent a few weekends together, and spend every evening talking for hours and throughout the day message or have short phone calls. We just click… he says things that align with my thinking and there’s no way for him to know how I think about those topics. 
Here’s the thing, he is halfway through a divorce and has two kids. Everything regarding the situation, that he’s told me about, has checked out so far. I have not met the kids, but one is excited to meet me, the other is more hesitant. My parents don’t love the situation, and I can understand why but they also have no interest in meeting him which would help explain things I believe. I don’t think there’s anyway for them to get it… I am just slightly lost. Is it really an impossible situation? Any advice? Thank you in advance! 
 what do you think makes this impossible? [Not Relevant]"
"Hi, I’m a 27 year old male. I recently went on a date with a girl (25). Long story short we went on a date and we got along pretty well, at least in my opinion. We had a lot in common and had a lot of the same views. By the end of the date she says, “I’d really like to see you again” I reply with “I’d really like to see you again too”. By the time I get home, I let her know I get home and she said she hasn’t also gotten home. I thank her for going on a date with me and for letting me to get to know her. I texted her day later saying “hope she is having a great day and hope she slept well”. It’s been 2 days and has responded since. However she’s posted on Instagram. Am I getting ghosted? 

Also, before we left each other she gave me a little plushie and said, “hey hold onto this until we see each other again.”  Woman here, you are not necesseraly being ghosted. Not replying after ONLY 2 days is in my opinion normal. Nowadays there is so much pressure from everyone to reply fast. You have to imagine, the work e-mails/phone call her familly friends, posting on Instagram... of course you come only after all that! She just met you, posting on Instagram does not mean she does not like you, it just means you are not her top priority yet, at the end of day, with limited time to do things. After 2 days,  I would say that's pretty healthy from her. She also gave you clear signs of wanting to see tou again. Now she might be lying or change her mind later but you have no ways to either know that or in influence it. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I was trying to date a guy.  We have 6 met times and I had told him during the second date that I was looking for a serious relationship. 

I was very clear about my intentions and he said he wanted the same but his business was a priority. He moved out of the city to a place 2 hours away. It was never clear about when we would meet next because he is busy with his business and he told me his schedule is crazy with the business in different cities. I even paid for one of our dinner dates because I didn't want money to be factor holding us back. 

We made out for a very long time on our 5th date so I would say that we have been intimate.  He has never been a great or consistent texter but I thought that's how he was 

However,  when one of our texts got sexual he was texting me almost every other day when previously it was just maybe once a week.  All texts are sexual with no definite mention of when we will meet next.  It almost felt like he just wanted to come to my place to crash, have sex and then leave.  

However,  this text really creeped me out.

He says "" I will come and get you and will take you somewhere.  Then I will take advantage of you being alone. ""

When I ask him to clarify,  he says "" basically a weekend gateway date where we would fuck and be together. ""

I don't know what someone thinks but "" taking advantage of you being alone"" sounds like a guy with bad intentions. Am I overreacting? In this context I would say he was trying to be suggestive, if he had any actual predatory intentions he would never say such a thing.   What does your gut tell you ?

"We've been together for 7 months. He is 5'5 and I'm 5'9. I'm eternally grateful to have him in my life and I've never cared about men's height so him being shorter than me doesn't make a difference.

Since the beginning of our relationship two of my close friends have been making rude remarks to me about our height difference. They act super nice to him but once he is gone they start saying things to me like ""You are so much bigger than him!"" (he is literally a bodybuilder), ""Kissing him must be weird'', ""Do you feel embarrassed?"", ""Do you wish he was taller?"", ""You need to be with a tall man, leave him for the shorties"" and so on. I've told them multiple times that I genuinely don't care, that none of those things are true and that I don't feel like I'm making a compromise. But they still think that deep down I suffer in silence because he isn't ""tall enough"".

These comments always feel directed at me and with the intent to make me feel bad for being taller. Yesterday at a party we were playing truth or dare and my friend asked him if he wished I was shorter. He laughed and said no but I still feel bad. This same friend used to have a crush on him before we started dating so I'm sure she isasking out of spite and not curiosity.

I started feeling a bit self-conscious about my height and like my boyfriend wouldn't want to be with me. I know it's stupid to think that way especially since he's always told me I'm perfect and all and isn't insecure about his own height. I told him about how I feel, he was nothing but supportive and said that my friends are just trying to plant the seeds of doubt. He said that it would be best to cut them off entirely from my life. I'm starting to think that he is right.

What do you guys think? How should I proceed from now on? Your friends are assholes. You can either call them on their assholery like “why are you body shaming him, why are you body shaming me, he’s more than his height, etc, why are you all more concerned with his height vs how happy I am with him” or look at them like they are daft. 

You know that meme of the little blonde toddler making that “I’m so confused, and I think your stupid” face? Next time they make comments, make that face, and ask if they are ok. That’s it. If they ask what you mean, repeat it. Then either change the subject or get up and leave the room. [Practical Advice]"

"We have been dating for almost 5 years. At the beginning of our relationship, I asked him to take pictures of and post the ring for sale on his eBay. He said the quality of the diamond was low and that he couldn’t sell it. He kept on saying he had it and it was safe with him every time I asked him. I didn’t care much for the ring as it came from my ex who ended up being abusive hence the reason why I divorced him. My kids were involved in the proposal and when I saw them standing there with my boyfriend while he was proposing even though I recognized the ring, I just couldn’t say no. This whole situation is making me feel kid of tricked and disappointed. This is definitely not how I wanted the next phase of the relationship to begin. I talked to him about it and he said he might get a different ring but I’m feeling almost resentful about it. How should I deal with this situation?   Dude is too cheap, lazy, and too stupid to not realize your old wedding/engagement ring would not be a welcome gift. Better to end it now than have a life of misery and resentment with him.

"I have very low self esteem due to my upbringing. I have tried therapy multiple times but can’t seem to overcome it.  

This has taken a massive toll on my dating life, as I believe that I would be doing someone a disservice by having them date someone like me, when many other (and “better”) options are available to them. As a result, I haven’t dated anyone, and I am 25. I reject people because I feel like I am saving them from a bullet, yet I feel a deep sense on loneliness at my inability to allow myself to experience love.

I understand this is irrational and that relationships aren’t locked contracts that one can’t leave, but has anyone else experienced this type of fear?  Yes. But I also suffer from imposter syndrome at work etc. I think the two are connected somehow. [Commentator's opinion]"
"I'm a 23F dating a 25M for a few months. I recently discovered he didn't graduate high school, while I'm currently in college. I don't think he's dumb or lacks emotional intelligence, but I sometimes worry about our relationship's future fulfillment. I've always dated or been friends with people who are in college or have graduated. He earns around $80k a year, while I'm still in school and job hunting. He doesn't seem to mind that and is happy with me.

However, when I bring up certain topics, he often doesn't engage because he ""doesn't ever think about those things."" His family doesn't seem to think critically about certain subjects either. I try not to be condescending, but I get bored with small talk and pop culture (even with him). He will sometimes make comments like “you’re so smart” while pinching my cheeks, after I’ve said something that is common sense??

I've dated guys who are more knowledgeable, which I find attractive, but I always worried about boring them or being used. I've also rejected guys with dead-end jobs because I don't find that attractive. My ex was very patronizing and made me feel dumb all the time, so I have some trauma from that. Might be the reason why I’ve self sabotaged previous relationships? Despite this, my current boyfriend has many redeeming qualities and I am very attracted to him. I just have anxiety over this at times.

"Hi all, I'm the type of person who likes to help as much as I can with suggestions and ideas on how to make their situation easier and my bf of 9 months has an online course he's taking but he's behind because of his time management. I've noticed every time I try to help and make it easier for him to find time he will shoot down my help by saying ""I can't because reason 1"" or ""that won't work because reason 2"".  
  
I am asking what I can do because I'm starting to feel useless and dumb now. I can't recall a time where I actually was able to help him because it was shot down. I like to help in relationships because my love language to show is acts of service and making things go smoothly for my partners so they're not stressed. What can I do better or differently? I feel kinda crappy and like a bad gf.  
  
Thank you guys and gals  
  
  
**\*\[tl;dr\]\*** When I try to help my bf my suggestions are usually countered and now I feel useless and want to find a different way to be helpful Your desire to help is genuine and heart-felt, but it's fair to say that your boyfriend has a large amount of pride and ego around his time-management woes.

It also seems that he does not appreciate the help you are trying to offer. This may be because he does not have faith in your ability to help, or your helping will expose some deficiency on his part (""he's dumb"" is the leading contender, with ""you are smarter than he is"" running a close second, and ""he screwed around until it was too late"" rounding out the Top Three).

His motto looks to be: 

*""Death before dishonor.""*

Ask him: would he rather *fail* without your help, than succeed *with* it?

His answer will tell how invested he is in salving his ego versus passing the class.

And to address your initial concern: **you are NOT dumb and useless.** In fact, you are *generous* and *caring*... just that HE cannot, or will not see that, and is determined to succeed or fail on his own merits, whatever the cost. [Emotional Support]"
"This is a rant post. 


So basically I (24F) talked to this cute guy (29M) everyday,everytime for 3 weeks and we had 2 dates that went really good, we kissed,hugged...

 Then he suddenly became distant during 2 days. He didnt reply at my text for 24 hours despite being online during the day so I texted him ""is everything okay?"" and he told me that he wants us to stop there because hes actually not ready for a relationship.

Now I have trust issues lol. I didnt see that coming.. he told me days before that he was excited to see me again etc.

Moreover I expected him because of his age to be more sure of what he wants and stuff. But well.. He might have avoidant attachment. I do have to say it’s better this happen now than months later when you are more attached [Commentator's opinion]"
